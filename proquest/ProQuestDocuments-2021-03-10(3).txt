Abstract: L’épisode d’agitation boursière causée par la spéculation sur les actions de l’entreprise GameStop est significatif à plus d’un titre. Il signale l’importance nouvelle que peuvent prendre les réseaux sociaux comme outils de coordination et de mobilisation financières. Alternate abstract: The stock market turmoil caused by speculation in the shares of GameStop is significant in more ways than one. It points to the new importance that social networks can assume as tools for financial coordination and mobilization.

Abstract: The stock market experienced whipsawing volatility and rising prices. [...]the year saw unprecedented growth in new accounts from individual investors at the full-service online brokerage platforms that make up Barron's 26th annual Best Online Brokers Survey. "In the past, generally, people felt that retail investors didn't have that much of an impact on the marketplace, that it was controlled 100% by institutional players, and there was some truth to that," says Christopher Larkin, E·Trade's managing director for digital brokerage product. [...]more-experienced investors demand both thoroughness and accessibility. Brokers must offer a wide array of material: entertaining tutorials, plainlanguage cues, portfolio builders, and useful financial planners for the novice investor; profit-and-loss algorithms, trading heat maps, advanced charting strategies, and graphically represented research for the more experienced.

Full text: Headnote In a pandemic year, investors flocked to stocks, signing up in the millions for trading apps like Robinhood or to full-service brokerage platforms. In our ranking of the best online brokers, Interactive Brokers narrowly beat out Fidelity for the top spot.
The past year has been extraordinary by any measure. The stock market experienced whipsawing volatility and rising prices. The Covid-19 lockdowns, zero-interest rates, stimulus checks, lack of sports, and apparently sheer boredom fed a supercharged bull run. And the year saw unprecedented growth in new accounts from individual investors at the full-service online brokerage platforms that make up Barron's 26th annual Best Online Brokers Survey.
This flood of new investors also produced some drama more recently. In late January, the shares of struggling videogame retailer GameStop (ticker: GME), whipped up on an online message board at Reddit called r/WallStreetBets, erupted. Suddenly, nearly everyone was opining on covered calls, short squeezes, meme trading, and the rapidly rising, then plummeting, prices of a group of beaten-down stocks.
This became known as the "Robinhood phenomenon," a nod to a trading app used by 13 million millennials and Gen Zers, which stirred controversy, not to say litigation and regulatory scrutiny, after it was forced to restrict trading at the height of the mania. Robinhood, founded in 2013, had popularized fractional shares and zerodollar commissions on an app and website featuring swipe-to-trade ease. The frenzy around GameStop highlighted how far individual investors had come in terms of numbers, influence, and strength-a trend that few had anticipated before Covid arrived.
The numbers are big. By the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2020, TD Ameritrade's daily average trading volume had risen four times from the volume traded at the beginning of that fiscal year. The number of retail brokerage accounts at Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) grew by 56% in 2020, while tastytrade's smaller client base almost doubled. Fidelity added more than three million clients, giving it 26.5 million accounts by year end.
"In the past, generally, people felt that retail investors didn't have that much of an impact on the marketplace, that it was controlled 100% by institutional players, and there was some truth to that," says Christopher Larkin, E·Trade's managing director for digital brokerage product. "But you've seen over the past year that retail has had a meaningful impact on market movements."
Robinhood and other financialtechnology apps such as Webull and Moomoo have never been part of the Online Broker Survey, an issue we've aired over the past few years. Our focus has always been on brokers that cater to a wide range of investors and offer a broad array of services and sophisticated analytical and research capabilities besides trade execution. That's reflected in our survey, which has 76 separate questions, six categories, and 98 subcategories. We conduct remote interviews, and the firms demo their platforms for us, often responding with written answers to questions. And we independently put the platforms through their paces.
This year, we decided to see how Robinhood would fare against the fullservice brokerages. Robinhood trailed the field, though it wasn't a complete wipeout. Robinhood is easy to use, offers the ability to trade equities, some options, and cryptocurrencies, and has a clean, attractive design. The downside: It lacks the panoply of services and on-site resources of the full-service brokers. (To delve more deeply into the details of individual brokerages, including Robinhood, turn to page 28.)
"We're making investing less scary, more accessible, personal, and easier, and offering features and tools that are optimized for mobile," said a Robinhood representative in response to our survey questions.
Barron's recognizes that, given the size of the user base, the fintech trading apps have become significant forces, and certainly bear close watching. And like many of their users, they haven't been at this very long. The full-service brokers were once relatively rudimentary themselves.
For the full-service brokers, the year featured nonstop challenges. They had to suddenly adjust to pandemic-induced remote working while reassuring existing clients and absorbing millions of new clients, not to mention maneuvering through the GameStop affair.
Barron's ranked 11 online brokerages that offer a broad range of tools useful to mainstream, self-directed investors of various stripes. Three brokerages did not participate (as they did not last year): Firstrade, Vanguard, and You Invest, JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) self-directed brokerage.
In this year's survey, Interactive Brokers again leads the pack, with Fidelity close behind. This echoes our 2019 survey; last year, the two tied for first. This year, it was close enough that we awarded them both five stars.
TD Ameritrade came in a strong third, E·Trade was fourth, and Charles Schwab (SCHW), which now owns TD Ameritrade, came immediately behind in fifth place, as it did last year. That marked a oneposition rise for TD Ameritrade, while E·Trade dropped one position. Some of this is a function of rejiggering the relative weights in a few categories, although it also reflects some impressive improvements by TD Ameritrade and Schwab.
Tastyworks and Merrill Edge tied for sixth place, with just a single point separating the two.
These full-service online brokerages have long attempted to cater to investors of all stripes. In 2020, the pandemic provided both time and opportunity, and boatloads of new investors came aboard. Many of these were younger. Ally Invest, for example, says that millennials drove about half of its overall growth last year. But this phenomenon extends further. Ally reported that the growth rate of women overall outpaced men.
The industry's stunning growth put these platforms under great pressure. Fidelity says that it hired more than 5,000 new customer-facing personnel to handle the increased volume, while other brokerages scampered to find and train enough new employees to service them.
The brokerages didn't just tread water. Many are actively transforming themselves, both functionally and aesthetically. They're becoming more welcoming and less an amalgam of words, numbers, and line graphs that require endless clicks. Brokerages are layering ease of use and contemporary graphics on ever-more powerful and sophisticated investing and trading engines. In some ways, Merrill Edge led the way with its reimagined site stressing "stories" that the Bank of America (BAC) unit rolled out over the past three years. Merrill's emphasis on context continues, while others are refashioning their sites, as well.
"We've definitely seen a movement toward simplification in design," says Jennifer Butler, the director of asset management and brokerage research at consulting firm Corporate Insight. Brokerages, she says, have begun to rethink site architecture and labeling to make everything more intuitive.
The top online brokerages marry clarity and sophistication, which is no small feat. This allows latitude for both expert traders and novice investors.
One big goal of these brokerages is to gain clients and keep them for the long term, not just entice them to sign up until the next cool app comes along. That includes a migration to different products, such as advisory services, which in turn provides additional revenue.
"What a lot of brokerage firms are trying to do is deliver on a promise of comprehensive financial management that addresses not just a consumer's every product need, but also kind of a lifetime evolution of those needs," explains Butler.
A more thoughtful and intuitive approach to news, information, and research marks another aspect of this endeavor, and one that's particularly important this year. Brokerages approach this differently. But at heart, this involves two separate realizations. First, with all of the new participants in the market, brokerages must put investing into some kind of educational context, or risk losing the very people they want to keep and nurture. Second, more-experienced investors demand both thoroughness and accessibility. Rummaging around for information just doesn't cut it anymore.
Brokers must offer a wide array of material: entertaining tutorials, plainlanguage cues, portfolio builders, and useful financial planners for the novice investor; profit-and-loss algorithms, trading heat maps, advanced charting strategies, and graphically represented research for the more experienced. It's a tricky balance, providing necessary content without information overload for a wide range of trading expertise.
"Part wizard, part content curation," is how Bob Leavitt, TD Ameritrade's director of content strategy and development, describes one of his firm's educational efforts.
We examined all of these and dozens of other elements in online brokerage offerings for this year's survey.
Both Interactive Brokers and Fidelity demonstrated just how extensive and contextual these services can be. Each excels in multiple facets of the online trading universe. However, Interactive Brokers scored higher in three of the six scoring categories- information, trading, and international, a category that it easily won. It also won first place in active trading. (For more on how we ranked the brokerages, see page 29.)
Some brokerages do a much better job than others in key segments. For example, tastyworks offers a superb platform for active options and futures traders, but its strengths and trading prowess would be lost on more-occasional investors, and it lacks some of the foundations that we believe a novice investor needs.
Tastyworks is also the latest example of high stakes industry consolidation. In late January, the brokerage firm's parent, tastytrade, announced that it would be sold for $1 billion to the United Kingdom fintech and trading company IG Group Holdings (IGGHY). According to Tom Sosnoff, tastytrade's co-founder, there were five offers on the table for the company. Sosnoff and his partners chose IG Group, he says, because tastyworks has designs on a global presence. With licenses in 17 countries, IG Group will make that process quicker and simpler.
"I wanted an opportunity for us to take the world by storm," Sosnoff says.
The tastytrade acquisition followed two blockbuster deals. In early 2020, Morgan Stanley (MS) announced the acquisition of E·Trade for $13 billion, demonstrating how well-heeled institutional firms have their sights on the retail trade. A few months earlier, Schwab and TD Ameritrade Holding announced a $26 billion merger, constructing a mammoth operation that rivals Fidelity in the number of clients.
The deal for TD Ameritrade closed on Oct. 6, but Schwab says it will take another 18 to 36 months for integration to be complete. Schwab isn't saying a lot more about what a future combined platform will look like, although Jeff Chiappetta, Schwab's vice president of trading and education, notes that the merged company would definitely embrace TD Ameritrade's groundbreaking active-trading platform, thinkorswim, as well as what he calls "the whole thinkorswim ecosystem."
Last year, Schwab also acquired the fintech Motif for an undisclosed amount. Motif specializes in technology that crafts customized thematic portfolios, underscoring two more developments in the industry- thematic investing and direct indexing.
For instance, E·Trade offers themes that range from the traditional, such as undervalued largecaps or emerging markets, to ones that might resonate more with younger investors, including cybersecurity and videogaming.
These are beginning to migrate from themed exchange-traded funds and mutual funds to individual stock screens. Some brokerages, including Interactive Brokers, Merrill Edge, and Fidelity, prominently display on their trading and research sites environmental, social, and corporate governance, or ESG, ratings and peer comparisons. Interactive Brokers also offers an impact dashboard that vets investments through social and environmental indicators, and will soon launch a stand-alone app that performs the same task.
All of this is a nod to more-socially conscious investors.
Direct indexing enables investors to track an index by buying a sample of individual stocks, instead of simply owning exchange-traded funds or mutual funds that do the same. In the past, direct indexing was the domain of wealthier individuals or institutional clients. But it's now being democratized, thanks to another major industry trend: fractional-shares trading.
Robinhood was a pioneer of fractional-shares trading in 2019, followed by Interactive Brokers among full-service brokerages late in the year. Fidelity came a few weeks later, and both Schwab and TD Ameritrade embraced the development in May.
Fractional-shares trading arose because even one share in some of the biggest names in stocks-Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), or Tesla (TSLA), not to mention Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)-may be beyond the reach of many individual investors. Why not provide the ability to invest a dollar amount instead? This entices the less affluent, but also those who tend to think of investing in dollars instead of shares.
The days are over when trading fees and account sizes were barriers to such strategies. The industry is deep into a zero-commission, no-accountminimum environment, which has become the new normal only a year after brokerages eliminated fees.
With commissions pretty much dead, many wonder just how brokerages make money. This skepticism gained credence in mid-December, when Robinhood paid $65 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it misled customers by failing to explain that it collected substantial fees for routing trades to other firms for execution- what's commonly known as payment for order flow. This practice, the SEC said, resulted in inferior trade prices and outweighed zero commissions.
Online brokerages come down on both sides of the payment-for-orderflow issue, and our survey awarded points to those that don't engage in this practice. But those accepting payment for order flow stress that they disclose the practice in SEC filings and still provide the best execution prices for their clients. Firms also insist that their revenue models no longer depend on trade commissions.
Fidelity has led the charge against order-flow payments, while Interactive Brokers splits the baby and offers two plans. This is needlessly confusing. Its IBKR Lite plan, which was launched in October 2019, is designed for less active investors and doesn't charge commissions. It does pay for order flow, and limits access to some of the firm's more sophisticated tools. IBKR Pro bundles commissions, but offers what it calls "smart routing," which improves price performance as well as preferential margin rates and other financial inducements. So far, only about 5% of Interactive Brokers' one million clients have opted for its Lite version. However, Interactive in December acquired 70,000 retail brokerage clients from Folio Investments and expects many of them to choose the Lite version.
How brokerages balance active and less active traders, and how consumers respond, have been issues for several years. The brokerage survey has migrated more to the demands of longerterm investors, which our scoring reflects. It's our belief that the vast majority of self-directed investors aren't day trading, formulating complex options strategies, or able to spend every waking moment scrutinizing the markets. Their needs, requirements, and habits now dominate, although mainstream brokerages can't afford to turn their back on active traders, either.
Brokerages are scrambling to meet customers wherever and however they can. TD Ameritrade now counts nine different platforms in which clients can interact with the brokerage, everything from live TV to video on demand, and from Amazon.com's Alexa to Apple CarPlay. Some of these may be gimmicks. Others may be sweeteners. But it's the totality of what brokerages provide that makes the difference, as they strive to become indispensable to the financial lives of their customers, new and old. |B

Barron's recognizes that, given the size of the user base, the fintech trading apps have become significant forces, and certainly bear close watching. And like many of their users, they haven't been at this very long. The full-service brokers were once relatively rudimentary themselves.
For the full-service brokers, the year featured nonstop challenges. They had to suddenly adjust to pandemic-induced remote working while reassuring existing clients and absorbing millions of new clients, not to mention maneuvering through the GameStop affair.
Barron's ranked 11 online brokerages that offer a broad range of tools useful to mainstream, self-directed investors of various stripes. Three brokerages did not participate (as they did not last year): Firstrade, Vanguard, and You Invest, JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) self-directed brokerage.
In this year's survey, Interactive Brokers again leads the pack, with Fidelity close behind. This echoes our 2019 survey; last year, the two tied for first. This year, it was close enough that we awarded them both five stars.
TD Ameritrade came in a strong third, E*Trade was fourth, and Charles Schwab (SCHW), which now owns TD Ameritrade, came immediately behind in fifth place, as it did last year. That marked a one-position rise for TD Ameritrade, while E*Trade dropped one position. Some of this is a function of rejiggering the relative weights in a few categories, although it also reflects some impressive improvements by TD Ameritrade and Schwab.
Tastyworks and Merrill Edge tied for sixth place, with just a single point separating the two.
These full-service online brokerages have long attempted to cater to investors of all stripes. In 2020, the pandemic provided both time and opportunity, and boatloads of new investors came aboard. Many of these were younger. Ally Invest, for example, says that millennials drove about half of its overall growth last year. But this phenomenon extends further. Ally reported that the growth rate of women overall outpaced men.
Consolidate, Integrate
In late 2019, Schwab agreed to a merger with TD Ameritrade, joining two online brokerage powers in the sector's biggest deal yet.
* $26 Billion In 2021, Schwab's two platforms continue to operate separately, and may stay that way for another year.
The industry's stunning growth put these platforms under great pressure. Fidelity says that it hired more than 5,000 new customer-facing personnel to handle the increased volume, while other brokerages scampered to find and train enough new employees to service them.
The brokerages didn't just tread water. Many are actively transforming themselves, both functionally and aesthetically. They're becoming more welcoming and less an amalgam of words, numbers, and line graphs that require endless clicks. Brokerages are layering ease of use and contemporary graphics on ever-more powerful and sophisticated investing and trading engines. In some ways, Merrill Edge led the way with its reimagined site stressing "stories" that the Bank of America (BAC) unit rolled out over the past three years. Merrill's emphasis on context continues, while others are refashioning their sites, as well.
"We've definitely seen a movement toward simplification in design," says Jennifer Butler, the director of asset management and brokerage research at consulting firm Corporate Insight. Brokerages, she says, have begun to rethink site architecture and labeling to make everything more intuitive.
The top online brokerages marry clarity and sophistication, which is no small feat. This allows latitude for both expert traders and novice investors.
One big goal of these brokerages is to gain clients and keep them for the long term, not just entice them to sign up until the next cool app comes along. That includes a migration to different products, such as advisory services, which in turn provides additional revenue.
"What a lot of brokerage firms are trying to do is deliver on a promise of comprehensive financial management that addresses not just a consumer's every product need, but also kind of a lifetime evolution of those needs," explains Butler.
A more thoughtful and intuitive approach to news, information, and research marks another aspect of this endeavor, and one that's particularly important this year. Brokerages approach this differently. But at heart, this involves two separate realizations. First, with all of the new participants in the market, brokerages must put investing into some kind of educational context, or risk losing the very people they want to keep and nurture. Second, more-experienced investors demand both thoroughness and accessibility. Rummaging around for information just doesn't cut it anymore.
Brokers must offer a wide array of material: entertaining tutorials, plain-language cues, portfolio builders, and useful financial planners for the novice investor; profit-and-loss algorithms, trading heat maps, advanced charting strategies, and graphically represented research for the more experienced. It's a tricky balance, providing necessary content without information overload for a wide range of trading expertise.
"Part wizard, part content curation," is how Bob Leavitt, TD Ameritrade's director of content strategy and development, describes one of his firm's educational efforts.
We examined all of these and dozens of other elements in online brokerage offerings for this year's survey.
Both Interactive Brokers and Fidelity demonstrated just how extensive and contextual these services can be. Each excels in multiple facets of the online trading universe. However, Interactive Brokers scored higher in three of the six scoring categories—information, trading, and international, a category that it easily won. It also won first place in active trading. (See How We Ranked the 2020 Best Online Brokers, below.)
Some brokerages do a much better job than others in key segments. For example, tastyworks offers a superb platform for active options and futures traders, but its strengths and trading prowess would be lost on more-occasional investors, and it lacks some of the foundations that we believe a novice investor needs.
Tastyworks is also the latest example of high stakes industry consolidation. In late January, the brokerage firm's parent, tastytrade, announced that it would be sold for $1 billion to the United Kingdom fintech and trading company IG Group Holdings (IGGHY). According to Tom Sosnoff, tastytrade's co-founder, there were five offers on the table for the company. Sosnoff and his partners chose IG Group, he says, because tastyworks has designs on a global presence. With licenses in 17 countries, IG Group will make that process quicker and simpler.
"I wanted an opportunity for us to take the world by storm," Sosnoff says.
The tastytrade acquisition followed two blockbuster deals. In early 2020, Morgan Stanley (MS) announced the acquisition of E*Trade for $13 billion, demonstrating how well-heeled institutional firms have their sights on the retail trade. A few months earlier, Schwab and TD Ameritrade Holding announced a $26 billion merger, constructing a mammoth operation that rivals Fidelity in the number of clients.
The deal for TD Ameritrade closed on Oct. 6, but Schwab says it will take another 18 to 36 months for integration to be complete. Schwab isn't saying a lot more about what a future combined platform will look like, although Jeff Chiappetta, Schwab's vice president of trading and education, notes that the merged company would definitely embrace TD Ameritrade's groundbreaking active-trading platform, thinkorswim, as well as what he calls "the whole thinkorswim ecosystem."
Last year, Schwab also acquired the fintech Motif for an undisclosed amount. Motif specializes in technology that crafts customized thematic portfolios, underscoring two more developments in the industry—thematic investing and direct indexing.
For instance, E*Trade offers themes that range from the traditional, such as undervalued large-caps or emerging markets, to ones that might resonate more with younger investors, including cybersecurity and videogaming.
These are beginning to migrate from themed exchange-traded funds and mutual funds to individual stock screens. Some brokerages, including Interactive Brokers, Merrill Edge, and Fidelity, prominently display on their trading and research sites environmental, social, and corporate governance, or ESG, ratings and peer comparisons. Interactive Brokers also offers an impact dashboard that vets investments through social and environmental indicators, and will soon launch a stand-alone app that performs the same task.
All of this is a nod to more-socially conscious investors.
Direct indexing enables investors to track an index by buying a sample of individual stocks, instead of simply owning exchange-traded funds or mutual funds that do the same. In the past, direct indexing was the domain of wealthier individuals or institutional clients. But it's now being democratized, thanks to another major industry trend: fractional-shares trading.
Robinhood was a pioneer of fractional-shares trading in 2019, followed by Interactive Brokers among full-service brokerages late in the year. Fidelity came a few weeks later, and Schwab embraced the development in May.
Big, Getting Bigger
Fidelity, like other online brokerages, saw a flood of new customers in 2020.
* 3 Million That left the firm with some 26.5 million accounts by year end.
Fractional-shares trading arose because even one share in some of the biggest names in stocks—Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), or Tesla (TSLA), not to mention Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)—may be beyond the reach of many individual investors. Why not provide the ability to invest a dollar amount instead? This entices the less affluent, but also those who tend to think of investing in dollars instead of shares.
The days are over when trading fees and account sizes were barriers to such strategies. The industry is deep into a zero-commission, no-account-minimum environment, which has become the new normal only a year after brokerages eliminated fees.
With commissions pretty much dead, many wonder just how brokerages make money. This skepticism gained credence in mid-December, when Robinhood paid $65 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it misled customers by failing to explain that it collected substantial fees for routing trades to other firms for execution—what's commonly known as payment for order flow. This practice, the SEC said, resulted in inferior trade prices and outweighed zero commissions.
Online brokerages come down on both sides of the payment-for-order-flow issue, and our survey awarded points to those that don't engage in this practice. But those accepting payment for order flow stress that they disclose the practice in SEC filings and still provide the best execution prices for their clients. Firms also insist that their revenue models no longer depend on trade commissions.
Fidelity has led the charge against order-flow payments, while Interactive Brokers splits the baby and offers two plans. This is needlessly confusing. Its IBKR Lite plan, which was launched in October 2019, is designed for less active investors and doesn't charge commissions. It does pay for order flow, and limits access to some of the firm's more sophisticated tools. IBKR Pro bundles commissions, but offers what it calls "smart routing," which improves price performance as well as preferential margin rates and other financial inducements. So far, only about 5% of Interactive Brokers' one million clients have opted for its Lite version. However, Interactive in December acquired 70,000 retail brokerage clients from Folio Investments and expects many of them to choose the Lite version.
How brokerages balance active and less active traders, and how consumers respond, have been issues for several years. The brokerage survey has migrated more to the demands of longer-term investors, which our scoring reflects. It's our belief that the vast majority of self-directed investors aren't day trading, formulating complex options strategies, or able to spend every waking moment scrutinizing the markets. Their needs, requirements, and habits now dominate, although mainstream brokerages can't afford to turn their back on active traders, either.
Brokerages are scrambling to meet customers wherever and however they can. TD Ameritrade now counts nine different platforms in which clients can interact with the brokerage, everything from live TV to video on demand, and from Amazon.com's Alexa to Apple CarPlay. Some of these may be gimmicks. Others may be sweeteners. But it's the totality of what brokerages provide that makes the difference, as they strive to become indispensable to the financial lives of their customers, new and old.

Full text: The past year has been extraordinary by any measure. The stock market experienced whipsawing volatility and rising prices. The Covid-19 lockdowns, zero-interest rates, stimulus checks, lack of sports, and apparently sheer boredom fed a supercharged bull run. And the year saw unprecedented growth in new accounts from individual investors at the full-service online brokerage platforms that make up Barron's 26th annual Best Online Brokers Survey.
This flood of new investors also produced some drama more recently. In late January, the shares of struggling videogame retailer GameStop (ticker: GME), whipped up on an online message board at Reddit called r/WallStreetBets, erupted. Suddenly, nearly everyone was opining on covered calls, short squeezes , meme trading , and the rapidly rising, then plummeting, prices of a group of beaten-down stocks.
This became known as the "Robinhood phenomenon," a nod to a trading app used by 13 million millennials and Gen Zers, which stirred controversy, not to say litigation and regulatory scrutiny , after it was forced to restrict trading at the height of the mania . Robinhood, founded in 2013, had popularized fractional shares and zero-dollar commissions on an app and website featuring swipe-to-trade ease. The frenzy around GameStop highlighted how far individual investors had come in terms of numbers, influence, and strength—a trend that few had anticipated before Covid arrived.
The numbers are big. By the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2020, TD Ameritrade's daily average trading volume had risen four times from the volume traded at the beginning of that fiscal year. The number of retail brokerage accounts at Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) grew by 56% in 2020, while tastytrade's smaller client base almost doubled. Fidelity added more than three million clients, giving it 26.5 million accounts by year end.
"In the past, generally, people felt that retail investors didn't have that much of an impact on the marketplace, that it was controlled 100% by institutional players, and there was some truth to that," says Christopher Larkin, E*Trade's managing director for digital brokerage product. "But you've seen over the past year that retail has had a meaningful impact on market movements."
More Best Online Brokers for 2021
Robinhood and other financial-technology apps such as Webull and Moomoo have never been part of the Online Broker Survey, an issue we've aired over the past few years. Our focus has always been on brokers that cater to a wide range of investors and offer a broad array of services and sophisticated analytical and research capabilities besides trade execution. That's reflected in our survey, which has 76 separate questions, six categories, and 98 subcategories. We conduct remote interviews, and the firms demo their platforms for us, often responding with written answers to questions. And we independently put the platforms through their paces.
This year, we decided to see how Robinhood would fare against the full-service brokerages. Robinhood trailed the field, though it wasn't a complete wipeout. Robinhood is easy to use, offers the ability to trade equities, some options, and cryptocurrencies, and has a clean, attractive design. The downside: It lacks the panoply of services and on-site resources of the full-service brokers.
"We're making investing less scary, more accessible, personal, and easier, and offering features and tools that are optimized for mobile," said a Robinhood representative in response to our survey questions.
Barron's recognizes that, given the size of the user base, the fintech trading apps have become significant forces, and certainly bear close watching. And like many of their users, they haven't been at this very long. The full-service brokers were once relatively rudimentary themselves.
For the full-service brokers, the year featured nonstop challenges. They had to suddenly adjust to pandemic-induced remote working while reassuring existing clients and absorbing millions of new clients, not to mention maneuvering through the GameStop affair.
Barron's ranked 11 online brokerages that offer a broad range of tools useful to mainstream, self-directed investors of various stripes. Three brokerages did not participate (as they did not last year): Firstrade, Vanguard, and You Invest, JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) self-directed brokerage.
In this year's survey, Interactive Brokers again leads the pack, with Fidelity close behind. This echoes our 2019 survey; last year, the two tied for first. This year, it was close enough that we awarded them both five stars.
TD Ameritrade came in a strong third, E*Trade was fourth, and Charles Schwab (SCHW), which now owns TD Ameritrade, came immediately behind in fifth place, as it did last year. That marked a one-position rise for TD Ameritrade, while E*Trade dropped one position. Some of this is a function of rejiggering the relative weights in a few categories, although it also reflects some impressive improvements by TD Ameritrade and Schwab.
Tastyworks and Merrill Edge tied for sixth place, with just a single point separating the two.

Full text: Salvador Vergara was so enthusiastic about GameStop Corp. in late January that he took out a $20,000 personal loan and used it to purchase shares. Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80%.
GameStop's volatile ride is hitting the portfolios of individual investors like Mr. Vergara who purchased the stock in a social-media-fueled frenzy. These casual traders say GameStop was their "YOLO," or "you only live once," trade. They bought around its late January peak, betting it would continue its astronomical climb. While some cashed out before it crashed , others who hung onto their shares are in the red.

'I thought it could go up to $1,000. I really believed in that hype, which was an awful thing to do,' Mr. Vergara says. PHOTO: Farrah Skeiky for the Wall Street Journal
Mr. Vergara, a 25-year-old security guard in Virginia, started investing four years ago after deciding he wanted to retire young. To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds, which are now valued at about $50,000. Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of the WallStreetBets page on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock's colossal rise.
He didn't want to touch his index-fund investments, so instead he got a personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to fund most of his GameStop purchase. He bought shares at $234 each.
GameStop shares started the year around $19, zoomed to nearly $350 (and almost hit $500 in intraday trading) in late January, and then began to spiral back to earth. The shares closed Friday at $52.40, down 85% from the peak close.
"I thought it could go up to $1,000. I really believed in that hype, which was an awful thing to do," Mr. Vergara said.
He plans to hold on to the shares because he believes in the company's turnaround, he said, and use his paycheck to cover the monthly payments on the personal loan. Once the pandemic is over, he hopes to move back to his native Philippines, live off savings and start a charity. The GameStop loss set those plans back about six months, he said.
Free trading and simple-to-use apps have made it much easier for regular investors to pour money into stocks like GameStop. In a world without international travel, live entertainment and other usual pastimes, brokerage apps such as Robinhood Markets Inc. are drawing hordes of new users looking for both a diversion and a jackpot.
Before the pandemic, Patrick Wesolowski checked his portfolio once a week. Then the clients of his Chicago-area dog-walking business stopped taking vacations and started working from home, crimping his income and leaving him with lots of free time.
With business sluggish, the 31-year-old started spending more time researching stocks to include in his $15,000 portfolio. He "lurked" on WallStreetBets, reading about other investors' wild bets but not posting much himself. "It's like reading 'Florida Man' news headlines with a Wall Street twist," he said.
In recent months, Mr. Wesolowski found himself picking up his smartphone to check his Fidelity Investments brokerage-account balance more often. He followed the frenzy around GameStop, and when shares were approaching $300 decided to put in $3,000. Afterward, he checked his portfolio on his phone every 10 minutes. At first, watching the stock drop made him feel queasy, but then he got used to it.
"If I lose it, I lose it. I'm OK. It's like going to Vegas," Mr. Wesolowski said. If he still had that money, he said, he might have put it toward a personal splurge like a vacation.
For many, GameStop represented more than just an investment. When Tony Moy bought about $1,200 of the shares, two at $379 and two more a few days later at $228, "I knew it was, intrinsically, the wrong move," he said.
Mr. Moy wasn't surprised when the stock quickly lost much of its value. A casual reader of WallStreetBets, he was mostly excited about the push to stick hedge funds with losses. Some hedge funds that shorted the stock—betting the price would fall— suffered big losses , though others managed to make money during the turmoil.
The trade was an outlet for Mr. Moy's frustrations after an abysmal year, a "virtual protest" of sorts, he said. In 2020, after the pandemic shut down large gatherings, the Chicago-based artist lost most of his income from selling his work at comic conventions. He also came down with a bad case of Covid-19 that left him coughing for months. He said his more successful investing endeavors have helped him get by financially.
One of Mr. Moy's most recent works of art is inspired by "diamond hands," a phrase used on Reddit to describe hanging onto your position, no matter what. He is keeping his GameStop shares as a memento. "It's going to be a little reminder to me," he said, "of how 2020 was the year when hedge funds had a great year and everyone else was struggling."

Higher Ground
Stocks rose, erasing the previous week's losses, fueled by the Nasdaq and tech. Earnings were strong, led by record quarters from Alphabet and Amazon.com. Oil giants reported losses, including Exxon Mobil's $20 billion. Ford Motor and General Motors were hit by a chip shortage. And January saw a moderate pop in new jobs, after several months of declines. For the week, the Dow industrials rose 3.9%, to 31,148.24; the S&P 500, hitting another high, soared 4.6%, to 3886.83; and the Nasdaq surged 6%, to 13,856.30, also a record.
The Downside
Hedge funds retreated from short plays on GameStop and other high short-interest stocks, and prices and volatility thudded to earth. Investors faced decisions on when, or if, to sell. GameStop lost 80% and AMC Entertainment, 49%. Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from investors- $3.4 billion in a week. Day traders on Reddit, meanwhile, drove silver up to its highest point in eight years, then saw it slip as the CME Group applied higher margin requirements.

Johnson & Johnson applied for emergency-use authorization for its one-dose vaccine.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, head of the antitrust subcommittee, introduced a comprehensive rethinking of antitrust law, raising the pressure on Big Tech, particularly Alphabet and Facebook, already facing federal lawsuits.
The Defense
Former President Trump lost one legal team for his impeachment trial, apparently over disagreements on strategy and fees. Briefs from his new team argued it's unconstitutional to impeach a former president and it was his First Amendment right to express his election suspicions. The trial starts on Tuesday.

Full text: GameStop mania was a wake-up call, but now the capital markets have truly reached ludicrous mode.
Electric-car maker Tesla said in a securities filing Monday that it has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it expects to begin accepting payment in the cryptocurrency for its products in the future. Tesla shares and bitcoin both traded higher after the announcement. This follows social media posts by the auto maker's influential boss , Elon Musk, that already had helped drive bitcoin's price to a record. All told, the rally spurred by the announcement on Monday added more than $100 billion to bitcoin's market value, while Tesla shares also rose yet again.
The investment is more than symbolic for the company, being equivalent to Tesla's research-and-development tab for 2020. And while uniting two of the most popular investment themes under one roof is undoubtedly a winner today, the decision introduces even more risk to owning what is already one of the most speculative stocks of the current bull market.
As Tesla itself said in the filing, prices for digital assets such as bitcoin have been volatile in the past. Cryptocurrencies are a fairly recent development and their long-term adoption by consumers, investors and businesses is highly uncertain. That adds to the speculative fervor already gripping Tesla's stock price in a feedback loop. Indeed, the manager of the most popular active fund recently, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, has made big bets on both Tesla and a trust that owns bitcoin, fueling a record pace of inflows.
At a market value of about $800 billion, Tesla trades at about 6.5 times the combined value of Ford and General Motors, despite controlling a small fraction of the global auto market. And Tesla lately has been losing market share in Western Europe to competitors including Volkswagen, which has begun to compete aggressively in the electric category. The news of Tesla's bitcoin investment eclipsed a negative headline for the company Monday about quality issues identified in the important Chinese market .
While digital assets are relatively new, a tour of financial history suggests similar speculative use of an industrial company's funds aren't—and they have ended badly. About a century ago, General Motors required a bailout due to the stock speculation activities of founder William Durant. In the 1980s, widespread corporate speculation on Japanese land prices helped drive a stock bubble that eventually collapsed.
Those cautionary tales aren't likely to concern investors who are enjoying a giant stock-market party. But Tesla's monetary experiment, coupled with the individual-investor-driven stock-market madness of recent weeks, should have investors concerned that the consequences of staying at the party too late will be worse than leaving early.

Exxon Mobil and Chevron Talked Merger Last Year. But the Logic Has Faded.

Full text: Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest U.S. oil companies, discussed a megamerger last year that would leave the U.S. with one oil giant for the first time in decades, reports The Wall Street Journal. A deal would create a $300 billion or so company that could produce seven million barrels of oil and equivalents a day, making it the largest operator outside of Saudi Aramco. The Journal says talks are off, but could be restarted. Both companies declined to comment.
That the pair even considered merging is a sign of how much the industry has changed. Talks reportedly began as oil prices collapsed last year. Prices have since rebounded. Analysts worried that Exxon's cash flow would not cover its dividend, which happened in 2019 and 2020. But higher prices and cost cuts may allow it to self-finance the dividend.
In 1999, the merger of Exxon and Mobil led to a period of growth. "There were big new [drilling] opportunities in Venezuela, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and Angola that required capital," wrote Citi analyst Alastair Syme. "Mergers provided the industry with the balance sheets to compete."
Today, big producers are cutting back and focused on reducing breakeven levels. And, as CFRA's Stewart Glickman wrote, a merger would be unlikely to drive pricing power, with the new entity wielding only 7% of global oil production, 15% of U.S. refining capacity. That said, stranger things have happened. Exxon took a huge loss in the last quarter, its fourth in a row. It's facing a challenge from activist investors, and analysts are seeking ways to improve results. Talks could restart.

Full text: Day traders have sent your company's share price surging, seemingly without reason. What now?
That usually isn't on the long list of things corporate executives have to worry about, and especially not at a company struggling to reinvent itself. Your share price is usually seen as a real-time vote of confidence in how you are doing and, when times are good, a currency for raising capital or buying a competitor—except when your company's value rockets from $250 million a year ago to more than $25 billion in large part because of posts on a message board.
Shares of struggling retailer GameStop recently traded as high as $483 after closing at just below $19 last year and around $4 before the pandemic based on no real change in the company's business prospects. The plunge has been just as stark as the climb: The stock closed below $54 on Thursday. Similarly volatile trading spilled over to shares of other businesses facing serious challenges like AMC Entertainment Holdings, Express Inc. and Bed Bath and Beyond.
While the general public gawks at the price action, executives of the affected companies need to come up with a plan. They face some hard choices about whether to use an inflated stock price to raise more money for their company or even to boost their own wealth by cashing in stock options that are suddenly worth more. Those choices, as tempting as they may be, have real consequences.
Deciding whether to raise money is far more complicated than it might seem. The first instinct for holders of inflated stock is to sell it. That goes for companies just as much as individuals. After all, a high share price can have real business implications if there are people clamoring to buy it.
But a shareholder base of day traders is far less desirable to executives than one of institutional investors, who tend to act as long-term partners and are less erratic about their decision making. One would have been hard pressed to find a seasoned fund manager who would have bought shares of GameStop last week with a long-term view.
There are other complicating factors. For example, executives need to be mindful of their cost of capital, or how high a return investors will expect on new funding. They learn on the first day of business school that it typically costs more to sell a stake in the company than to take out a loan— but it briefly wasn't in the past weeks' Bizarro World. Your brand new shareholders probably won't be satisfied with how much money you just saved, however. Investors tend to sue when a new issue they just purchased drops like a rock, no matter how much legal boilerplate is in the prospectus.
Executives also need to consider the possibility of more aggressive regulation after all this chaos. The Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have taken an interest in the market situation, and Congress plans to hold hearings on recent trading activity on February 18. Acting SEC chair Allison Herren Lee said in a radio interview this week that the agency is watching whether issuers who choose to raise money in the current environment fully disclose any risks surrounding their stock. Ms. Lee also said the agency would be watching to see if corporate insiders trade personal holdings of stocks affected by the recent volatility.
Even a brief spike in the share price could make an executive's stock options worth spectacular sums for a short period of time, which gives insiders an opportunity to cash out. That decision may not be popular with investors either, and it could create a public relations issue at the same time.
Share Your Thoughts
What would you do if your company got pulled into the GameStop frenzy? Join the conversation below.
While this episode of market madness caught everyone by surprise, executives can start planning now for what to do if a sequel arises. They could turn to more unconventional financing methods such as convertible bonds, which allow borrowers to repay their debt with stock instead of cash if the shares are trading at a price that is satisfactory to the lender.
Or they can tap so-called "at the market" financing," or ATM, which allows companies to sell new shares directly into the market at prevailing prices. That differs from a traditional offering, where an investment bank will sell shares to institutional investors in one shot at a fixed price.
Traditionally these ATM offerings have been the domain of sleepy biotech companies, but that is changing. U.S. companies raised nearly $90 billion in 2020 via ATM programs, according to Dealogic. That includes $10 billion raised by stock market darling Tesla Inc.
AMC offers a prime example of these benefits: The company announced last week that it would settle $600 million in convertible debt with stock, and that it raised a fresh $300 million by selling stock via its ATM. All told, the wild trading freed up nearly $1 billion in cash—badly needed funding for a theater chain struggling with the impact of coronavirus.
GameStop hasn't yet missed the boat altogether. Even today's price is still far higher than most analysts thought possible. Its shares changed hands for $5 or less for much of 2020. It could have a chance to raise money at advantageous prices in the coming weeks once volatility subsides.
As for the rest of the publicly traded universe, the frenetic circumstances might mean new messaging is called for. Public company executives are fond of saying—perhaps fibbing—that they pay little to no attention to daily moves in their stock price. Given the Reddit-crazed markets of 2021, no one will blame them if that talking point is soon retired.

Full text: Jake Schlein began investing when he was 14 years old with the help of a $10,000 gift and a custodial account opened by his father.
He started out playing it safe—sticking to well-established companies like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.
Then the mania around GameStop Corp. erupted.
Jake bought 33 shares at $87 a piece last month after he and his friends saw the hype on Twitter, Discord and Reddit's notorious WallStreetBets forum. After a wild ride that sent the shares soaring as high as $483 on Jan. 28, GameStop closed Thursday at $53.50.
The now 16-year-old says he has no intention of selling the stock anytime soon—even though his father, a former Citigroup Inc. executive and longtime financial professional, has suggested he cash out.

"The stock price hardly matters right now," said Jake, who like many other investors, hasn't been deterred by GameStop's recent volatility. "I'm definitely riding with it."
The day-trading frenzy that has fired up stocks like GameStop, started a de facto war between hedge funds and Reddit traders and galvanized securities regulators is benefitting from capital provided by a growing number of young investors. Many of them are trying their hands at trading for the first time. And they have an entirely different viewpoint on the markets than their parents, for whom investing has often looked more like contributing to a 401(k) account, not diving into the trade du jour on social media.
"He actually thinks he's making history," said Linda O'Flanagan, a New Jersey resident whose 16-year-old son sold the entirety of his modest holdings last month so he could buy a single GameStop share and join the frenzy. "I said, 'Don't be silly,' but what do I know?"
Rarely has trading stocks looked this fun.
Ms. O'Flanagan's son, Connor, keeps GameStop's stock price up on a second screen so he can keep track of its movement while answering questions in online classes. He swears he even saw his math teacher sneak a look at GameStop's stock price at one point in class.
"It's cool how the internet came together…and it could just overthrow Wall Street," Connor said. He only intends to hold GameStop for a short while. "It's basically a ticking time bomb," he said of the stock's rally. His plans for any profit he comes out with? Put that money straight back into the market.
Ms. O'Flanagan has other dreams. "Hopefully he makes enough money to pay for college. What a load off!" she joked.
'The Fed just did what?'
It is no accident that teenagers like Jake and Connor had the chance to jump in on the GameStop mania. This generation has grown up in an era where trading has become as accessible as ever to the masses thanks to the rise of no-commission trading, the ability to purchase slivers of traditional shares for as little as $1 and the proliferation of free trading apps like Robinhood. The median age of users on Robinhood last year was 31, far younger than older rival Schwab's average of 52.

Zachary Cox, a 12-year-old from the U.K., only had 40 pounds ($55) to play with when he convinced his mom to open a custodial account for him last year on the British platform Trading 212.
He's invested in everything from U.K. stocks to payment company Square Inc. and electric car maker Fisker Inc. He even put a tiny sliver of his portfolio—less than 1% of it—into AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. after seeing the hype around the stock take off.
So far, it has paid off: Zachary's portfolio has more than doubled in the eight months since he started trading.
"By the time I'm 18, maybe I'll have enough money to pay to go to university," he said.
Social media is another tool that puts trading within reach of more young investors. Online communities and platforms like Reddit's WallStreetBets, Discord, Twitter and even TikTok have exploded with posts from users sharing everything from their latest portfolio recommendations to screenshots of their eye-watering losses. They have made the stock market hard to ignore, especially during particularly volatile periods like last week.
At age 13, Mya Parker is already active on both Twitter and YouTube. In fact, she said she learned almost everything she knows about investing from watching YouTube channels like "Financial Education," which uploads videos with titles like "The Fed Just Did What! Federal Reserve Go Brrrrrr" and "Are Airline Stocks Cheap to Buy Now!?"
Now, she runs a YouTube channel of her own, where she posts videos detailing her thoughts on her investments in companies like electric vehicle maker Arcimoto, Roku Inc. and Dropbox Inc.
Gavin Mayo, a 19-year-old college student, has made his name on TikTok . He's shared everything from videos parodying WallStreetBets to short and snappy explainers on gamma squeezes to his more than 230,000 followers on the platform.
Mr. Mayo admits his parents aren't exactly enthused he spends so much time trading and posting online. To placate them, he tries to stay on top of his grades while maintaining a busy posting schedule.
"I don't know if they really understand what I'm doing," Mr. Mayo said of his parents' views on his day trading adventures. "They've kinda just been safe with their 401(k)s."
Meet the parents
Parents do have some degree of control over their children's investing. In the U.S., minors need an adult—typically a parent—to open a custodial account for them. The adult retains control of the account until the minor reaches the age of majority. (In most states, that is 18; in some, it is 21.)
But any money in the account legally belongs to the minor. That means parents can't withdraw money once they have transferred it to the account, unless they use it for the direct benefit of the child.
Share Your Thoughts
If you have a teen trader in your life, how do you educate them about market risks? Join the conversation below.
Gains from investments are also subject to taxes—something financial advisers worry young investors scrambling to make a quick buck may be unaware of. While profits from stock sales and dividends of up to $1,100 are tax exempt in many cases, the next $1,100 is typically taxed at the child's tax bracket—usually between 10% and 12%. Beyond that, what's known as the Kiddie Tax kicks in. That means the child's investment income is taxed at the parents' marginal tax rate, instead of the lower child's tax rate.
Even if minors don't wind up selling their stocks, custodial accounts can cost those who apply for college financial aid.
Custodial accounts count as assets belonging to the child, meaning the bigger portfolios are, the less aid they are eligible for. Some financial planners estimate that financial aid payouts can be reduced by as much as 20% of the funds in a custodial account.
'You have to be willing to lose it all'
Individual investors' gains have been huge this year. But the losses have been just as punishing for those caught off guard.
GameStop, for instance, has plunged in a punishing reversal of its late January rally. Investors following the online crowd also racked up big losses last year when oil futures swiftly dropped below zero and highflying stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc. and Eastman Kodak Co. collapsed.
That hasn't put off parents from supporting their children's forays. Some are simply pleased their children have found a new hobby—even if they view their investment style as more akin to gambling than anything else.
"I haven't seen Connor so excited about anything since the start of the pandemic," Ms. O'Flanagan said.
And if Connor's investments don't pan out? "He's not going to lose thousands or millions of dollars," she said.
Jake, the 16-year-old in Brooklyn, has more to lose. He's more than doubled the value of his portfolio since starting his investment journey. But under the agreement he made with his father, he won't withdraw any of the money in his account until he turns 25.
"You have to be willing to lose it all," Jake said.

Comment les fonds ont profité de l'envolée de GameStop

Le fonds d'investissement new-yorkais Senvest Management a ainsi engrangé 700 millions de dollars de bénéfices sur GameStop, selon le « Wall Street Journal ». Les deux gestionnaires du fonds avaient commencé à s'intéresser au groupe en janvier 2020. Ils ont pris des parts en septembre dernier, au moment où l'investisseur activiste Ryan Cohen a fait son entrée au capital de GameStop. En septembre, les actions du distributeur de jeux vidéo valaient moins de 10 dollars. Fin octobre, Senvest détenait plus de 5 % du capital. Lorsque, soutenu par de , les gestionnaires du fonds n'ont pas bougé. Mais lorsqu'Elon Musk a tweeté « Gamestonk ! », après la fermeture des marchés, propulsant le cours à + 157 % à la réouverture le lendemain, Senvest a décidé de prendre ses gains. Il a ainsi revendu ses titres autour de 400 dollars, devenant l'un des fonds qui a le plus bénéficié de l'affaire. Un rendement augmenté de plus de 30 % D'autres grands acteurs ont également profité de la folie GameStop. Selon Morningstar, un fonds commun de placement de Morgan Stanley, le Morgan Stanley Institutional Inception, qui affiche maintenant 1,5 milliard de dollars d'encours, a dégagé une performance de 30 % en un mois, grâce à la hausse de 1.625 % de ses actions GameStop. Il s'est ainsi retrouvé propulsé en tête du classement de Morningstar pour les fonds d'actions américains. Le fonds semble s'être intéressé à GameStop en septembre dernier, au même moment que Senvest. Il déclarait alors détenir près de 350.000 actions de l'enseigne, pour une valeur d'environ 3,5 millions de dollars. Sa participation est passée à plus de 112 millions de dollars fin janvier. L'une des plus importantes participations dans GameStop reste cependant celle du fonds Fidelity's Series Intrinsic Opportunities, qui détenait près de 10 % des titres en circulation en octobre. Ces actions, équivalentes à 71 millions de dollars à l'époque, auraient valu plus de 2 milliards de dollars fin janvier. Cependant, les performances récentes du fonds laissent penser que Fidelity a vendu au moins une partie des actions avant que le cours ne s'emballe : le fonds n'a ainsi rapporté que 3,9 % en janvier. Outre les fonds spéculatifs, plusieurs dizaines de fonds indiciels cotés (ETF) détenaient également des titres GameStop lorsque l'action a démarré sa folle épopée. Les ETF sont en général passifs : leurs prises de position sur les marchés ne sont pas décidées par un gérant mais en fonction de règles établies lors de leur création. BlackRock et Vanguard, deux géants des ETF, détiennent ainsi à eux deux près de 20 % du capital de GameStop. Le fonds indiciel iShares Core S&P Small-Cap en possède à lui seul plus de 5 %. Une goutte d'eau dans son portefeuille de plus de 60 milliards de dollars répartis parmi des centaines de valeurs différentes. Pour ces géants, l'envolée de GameStop a eu un impact mineur sur les performances. Ils ont toutefois pu profiter de l'engouement des vendeurs à découvert en prêtant leurs titres. Pendant ce temps, le titre de GameStop était retombé en dessous des 70 dollars jeudi après-midi, des rapports faisant état d'investisseurs particuliers ayant acheté tardivement et déjà .

Cependant, les performances récentes du fonds laissent penser que Fidelity a vendu au moins une partie des actions avant que le cours ne s'emballe : le fonds n'a ainsi rapporté que 3,9 % en janvier.
Outre les fonds spéculatifs, plusieurs dizaines de fonds indiciels cotés (ETF) détenaient également des titres GameStop lorsque l'action a démarré sa folle épopée. Les ETF sont en général passifs : leurs prises de position sur les marchés ne sont pas décidées par un gérant mais en fonction de règles établies lors de leur création.
BlackRock et Vanguard, deux géants des ETF, détiennent ainsi à eux deux près de 20 % du capital de GameStop. Le fonds indiciel iShares Core S&P Small-Cap en possède à lui seul plus de 5 %. Une goutte d'eau dans son portefeuille de plus de 60 milliards de dollars répartis parmi des centaines de valeurs différentes. Pour ces géants, l'envolée de GameStop a eu un impact mineur sur les performances. Ils ont toutefois pu profiter de l'engouement des vendeurs à découvert en prêtant leurs titres.
Pendant ce temps, le titre de GameStop était retombé en dessous des 70 dollars jeudi après-midi, des rapports faisant état d'investisseurs particuliers ayant acheté tardivement et déjà perdu des sommes considérables.

Full text: [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Free trading has been a boon to online brokers, banks, investment advisers and fintech upstarts. But if frenzies like this keep up, it may prove to be costly, too.
A surge of activity in 2020 helped set trading-volume records for many brokers and collectively brought millions of new accounts, driven by a buoyant market and commission-free trading. But this past week's frenzy around GameStop and other stocks highlighted some potential downsides of this small-trader wave.
Moves by some trading platforms including Robinhood Markets to restrict some trading at times drew scrutiny from customers and politicians. Even shares of far bigger firms, such Charles Schwab, which owns TD Ameritrade, and Morgan Stanley, which owns E*Trade, were sold off sharply last week.
Those shares have rallied so far this week. But the question investors may be considering is whether a sustained explosion of trading is good for the online-trading business.
From a revenue standpoint, the absence of commissions and little return on customer cash due to superlow interest rates increases reliance on other revenue sources, like margin lending and payment-for-order flow. So called PFOF in particular, which involves sending customers' trading orders to wholesale market-making firms, drew attention over the past week. Whether warranted or not, regulatory changes or customer demands that limit this revenue source could make volume much less valuable.
The events of last week reveal another potential pressure on the trading business: liquidity and capital requirements. In its move to restrict some buying, Robinhood cited a 10-fold increase in the amount of cash it needed on deposit at the clearinghouse for settling trades. It raised more than $3 billion in new equity. To the extent future GameStop-like volatility and trade-flow imbalances are likely going forward, it raises the possibility that more capital and cash are just part of running a retail trading business, putting pressure on returns. Lawmakers may want to revisit requirements, too.
It is simply not cheap to handle this level of activity. Schwab executives on Tuesday noted a trend of increases in client servicing and expenses related to things like volumes and new-account openings. However, the company said it is confident in its merger cost-synergy targets with TD Ameritrade, and it expects trading volumes to moderate from pandemic levels over the longer term.
Some changes coming from this period could be helpful for brokers if Robinhood's call for instant-settlement at clearinghouses is heeded, seen as a way to reduce potential liquidity pressures. But short of that kind of structural change, normalization of activity is exactly what investors should hope to see.
For investment giants such as Schwab and Morgan Stanley, or a big retail bank that beefed up its trading offering like JPMorgan Chase, or fintech upstarts like Social Finance or Square, the lure of trading remains a good vehicle for acquiring young customers. If these customers join up with firms' larger platforms to do more investing, spending or banking with them, then they will be worth any potential trading headaches, especially once interest rates start to rise and the yields on loans and cash jump. But after the past several days, it is getting harder to see free trading as a good business unto itself.

Two Small-Time Investors Were Buying GameStop Stock Before It Was Cool; GameStop's rally has been credited to Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, but two relatively unknown investors were pushing for big changes more than a year prior

Full text: Last spring, when GameStop Corp. was just a struggling videogame retailer and before Reddit took it to the moon, two small money managers teamed up in an audacious bid to shake up its board of directors.
They thought the stock was worth a few more dollars.
They won, and then things got wild. Shares have zoomed from $4 all the way to above $400 and back to $90. John Broderick's Permit Capital has made more than $100 million, and Kurt Wolf's Hestia Capital is up around $50 million, at least in paper gains, according to regulatory filings. The duo risked their reputations on the future of GameStop and in doing so helped plant the seeds that turned into a stock rally that has captivated Wall Street.
"It's sort of like after the Super Bowl when they ask someone how it feels and they say it doesn't feel real," said Mr. Broderick. "I guess I can go to Disney World."
Their realized profits aren't quite equal to each other's right now, their stock-picking fairy tale colliding with the reality of corporate bylaws.
Mr. Broderick has been able to cash out much of his stake and book career-changing gains. Mr. Wolf, though, is now a director at the company, and board rules restrict his selling. He sold a piece at a big profit, but most of his potential gains are on paper, at the mercy of the rally's coming months. Just Tuesday, more than half of his gains disappeared.
A representative said Mr. Wolf declined to comment. GameStop hasn't commented on the trading.
The spark for GameStop's rally has been credited to Ryan Cohen, who co-founded online pet-supplies retailer Chewy Inc. His bet, disclosed in August, gave investors a reason to believe that someone was about to transform GameStop into an internet retailer . In November, Mr. Cohen sent a letter to the board urging just that kind of pivot, and asking for board seats.
When Mr. Cohen got a board seat in January, it created another sea change. A crowd of amateur stock pickers on Reddit believed in him and began buying shares in waves. That nearly sunk hedge funds that had been betting against GameStop in dangerously concentrated amounts. The result: Shares soared from some $18 to $325—an increase of more than 1,700%—in three weeks. They touched $483 in intraday trading last week. They fell sharply Tuesday, closing at $90.

But the path for Mr. Cohen's success was laid by Messrs. Broderick and Wolf, who were making an argument for value in GameStop long before it was cool. "We believe the fair value of the Company is at least $19 per share," they wrote last year when the stock was around $4.
They are far from Wall Street giants.
Mr. Wolf, 47 years old, started Hestia Capital in 2009 after working at hedge funds and co-founding a health-care startup. He first bought GameStop in 2012. His firm is so small it doesn't have to file the quarterly disclosures required of those that manage over $100 million in outside money. At its peak, Hestia had spent just under $7 million to buy about 2.1% of GameStop, according to filings.
Mr. Broderick, 51, manages Permit Capital, based in West Conshohocken, Pa., outside Philadelphia. It is part of a broader financial group started by former Morgan Stanley executive Richard Worley and onetime FAO Schwarz chairman Peter Morse. The fund is named after a particularly hard-to-catch fish.
Permit Capital managed about $287 million as of December. Mr. Broderick first bought GameStop stock in 2011. At its peak, Permit had spent about $35 million on a 5.5% stake, making it one of the biggest holders, according to filings.
By any normal standards of corporate activity, GameStop has already been through a hectic few years. The company has changed strategies and CEOs, run a failed process to sell itself, and had multiple investors suggesting ways it could do better.
At the start of 2019, Mr. Wolf sent a public letter to the board urging a massive repurchase of shares. When the company only partly agreed, he publicly called for board changes.
After seeing the letter, Mr. Broderick reached out to Mr. Wolf and they formed a team. A few days later, GameStop agreed to add two new directors.
The peace didn't hold. On March 12, 2020, Messrs. Wolf and Broderick demanded two more seats, including one for Mr. Wolf.
This time, the company stood fast, arguing it had a strategy in place and had changed its board enough.
To win a board fight, an investor needs to canvass shareholders and lobby them for votes. This one, they had to do amid a pandemic. Messrs. Wolf and Broderick weren't deterred.
To pay for the fight, Mr. Broderick said, he and Mr. Wolf racked up their personal credit cards and Permit borrowed to buy more stock on margin. Mr. Broderick had a new baby but seemed locked in his office. Mr. Wolf is raising five kids and some chickens outside Pittsburgh.
Mr. Broderick said he questioned whether the effort was worth it at times but that Mr. Wolf's excitement never waned.
"I call him the Monitor, as in the lizard," Mr. Broderick said. "He pursued this thing with incredible focus and with this intense energy every day."
Messrs. Wolf and Broderick argued that board members had squandered the shareholders' money and urged them again to buy back stock . They said the board was wasting the asset of an enviable set of loyal customers that a booming game industry needs to connect with.
In June, shareholders elected Mr. Wolf and the other nominee to the board.
Mr. Cohen announced his investment a few weeks later.
GameStop's fiscal quarter ended Saturday. Its board rules say directors cannot sell during a blackout period that starts seven days before the end of the quarter—in other words, starting the week when GameStop shares soared 400%. The blackout period lasts until the day after the company discloses the results, typically the middle of March.
Shortly after Mr. Cohen joined the board, Mr. Wolf's Hestia sold several chunks of stock at prices around $20 and $30 a share, for a total of about $17 million, according to filings. That was already a significant return on the original investment, and left Hestia with 431,000 shares.
By the end of that week, board members were barred from selling more, just as the trading entered a new stratosphere.
Last week, Mr. Wolf watched his position rise to a value of $210 million and fall back to $80 million. At the close of Tuesday, it was around $40 million.
Mr. Broderick declined to say how much Permit has sold but that he significantly scaled back his investment as the price became untethered from fundamentals.
As of the end of the year, Permit had already sold about 2 million shares, according to filings. That would have brought in an estimated $21.5 million, based on closing prices. The firm still held 1.23 million shares, which, if sold at last month's average closing price, would have been another $100 million in proceeds.
While he still believes in GameStop's future, and thinks Messrs. Wolf and Cohen can turn it into an internet retailer, Mr. Broderick doesn't believe the stock is worth $300 a share. But he also no longer believes the $19 he and Mr. Wolf pitched last year is high enough.
"This," Mr. Broderick said, "has been the single craziest week of my life."

Full text: Last spring, when GameStop Corp. was just a struggling videogame retailer and before Reddit took it to the moon, two small money managers teamed up in an audacious bid to shake up its board of directors.
They thought the stock was worth a few more dollars.
They won, and then things got wild. Shares have zoomed from $4 all the way to above $400, and John Broderick's Permit Capital and Kurt Wolf's Hestia Capital have each made probably more than $100 million, at least in paper gains, according to regulatory filings. The duo risked their reputations on the future of GameStop and in doing so helped plant the seeds that turned into a stock rally that has captivated Wall Street.
"It's sort of like after the Super Bowl when they ask someone how it feels and they say it doesn't feel real," said Mr. Broderick. "I guess I can go to Disney World."
Their realized profits aren't quite equal to each other's right now, their stock-picking fairy tale colliding with the reality of corporate bylaws.
Mr. Broderick has been able to cash out much of his stake and book career-changing gains. Mr. Wolf, though, is now a director at the company, and board rules restrict his selling. He sold a piece at a big profit, but most of his potential gains are on paper, at the mercy of the rally's coming months.
A representative said Mr. Wolf declined to comment. GameStop hasn't commented on the trading.
The spark for GameStop's rally has been credited to Ryan Cohen, who co-founded online pet retailer Chewy Inc. His bet, disclosed in August, gave investors a reason to believe that someone was about to transform the company into an internet retailer . In November, Mr. Cohen sent a letter to the board urging just that kind of pivot, and asking for board seats.
When Mr. Cohen got a board seat in January, it created another sea change. A crowd of amateur stock pickers on Reddit believed in him and began buying shares in waves. That nearly sunk hedge funds that had been betting against GameStop in dangerously concentrated amounts. The result: Shares soared from some $18 to $325—an increase of more than 1,700%—in three weeks. They touched $483 in intraday trading last week. They closed at $225 on Monday.

But the path for Mr. Cohen's success was laid by Messrs. Broderick and Wolf, who were making an argument for value in GameStop long before it was cool. "We believe the fair value of the Company is at least $19 per share," they wrote last year when the stock was around $4.
They are far from Wall Street giants.
Mr. Wolf, 47, started Hestia Capital in 2009 after working at hedge funds and co-founding a health-care startup. He first bought GameStop in 2012. His firm is so small it doesn't have to file the quarterly disclosures required of those that manage over $100 million in outside money. At its peak, Hestia had spent just under $7 million to buy about 2.1% of GameStop, according to filings.
Mr. Broderick, 51, manages Permit Capital, based in West Conshohocken, Pa., outside Philadelphia. It's part of a broader financial group started by former Morgan Stanley executive Richard Worley and onetime FAO Schwarz chairman Peter Morse. The fund is named after a particularly hard-to-catch fish.
Permit Capital managed about $287 million as of December. Mr. Broderick first bought GameStop stock in 2011. At its peak, Permit had spent about $35 million on a 5.5% stake, making it one of the biggest holders, according to filings.
By any normal standards of corporate activity, GameStop has already been through a hectic few years. The company has changed strategies and CEOs, run a failed process to sell itself, and had multiple investors suggesting ways it could do better.
At the start of 2019, Mr. Wolf sent a public letter to the board urging a massive repurchase of shares. When the company only partly agreed, he publicly called for board changes.
After seeing the letter, Mr. Broderick reached out to Mr. Wolf and they formed a team. A few days later, GameStop agreed to add two new directors.
The peace didn't hold. On March 12, 2020, Messrs. Wolf and Broderick demanded two more seats, including one for Mr. Wolf.
This time, the company stood fast, arguing it had a strategy in place and had changed its board enough.
To win a board fight, an investor needs to canvass shareholders and lobby them for votes. This one, they had to do amid a pandemic. Messrs. Wolf and Broderick weren't deterred.
To pay for the fight, Mr. Broderick said, he and Mr. Wolf racked up their personal credit cards and Permit borrowed to buy more stock on margin. Mr. Broderick had a new baby but seemed locked in his office. Mr. Wolf is raising five kids and some chickens outside Pittsburgh.
Mr. Broderick said he questioned whether the effort was worth it at times but that Mr. Wolf's excitement never waned.
"I call him the Monitor, as in the lizard," Mr. Broderick said. "He pursued this thing with incredible focus and with this intense energy every day."
Messrs. Wolf and Broderick argued that board members had squandered the shareholders' money and urged them again to buy back stock . They said the board was wasting the asset of an enviable set of loyal customers that a booming game industry needs to connect with.
In June, shareholders elected Mr. Wolf and the other nominee to the board.
Mr. Cohen announced his investment a few weeks later.
GameStop's fiscal quarter ended Saturday. Its board rules say directors cannot sell during a blackout period that starts seven days before the end of the quarter—in other words, starting the week when GameStop shares soared 400%. The blackout period lasts until the day after the company discloses the results, typically the middle of March.
Shortly after Mr. Cohen joined the board, Mr. Wolf's Hestia sold several chunks of stock at prices around $20 and $30 a share, for a total of about $17 million, according to filings. That was already a significant return on the original investment, and left Hestia with 431,000 shares.
By the end of that week, board members were barred from selling more, just as the trading entered a new stratosphere.
Last week, Mr. Wolf watched his position rise to a value of $210 million and fall back to $80 million. Monday night, it was around $100 million.
Mr. Broderick declined to say how much Permit has sold but that he significantly scaled back his investment as the price became untethered from fundamentals.
As of the end of the year, Permit had already sold about 2 million shares, according to filings. That would have brought in an estimated $21.5 million, based on closing prices. The firm still held 1.23 million shares, which, if sold at last month's average closing price, would have been another $100 million in proceeds.
While he still believes in GameStop's future, and thinks Messrs. Wolf and Cohen can turn it into an internet retailer, Mr. Broderick doesn't believe the stock is worth $300 a share. But he also no longer believes the $19 he and Mr. Wolf pitched last year is high enough.
"This," Mr. Broderick said, "has been the single craziest week of my life."

Full text: Small investors banding together online to pump up stocks like GameStop Corp. say they are defying Wall Street. But one of the biggest players in global markets stands to benefit from their frenetic trading.
Citadel Securities, the electronic-trading firm owned by hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin, has played a quiet but critical role in the frenzy of the last two weeks.
The firm, an affiliate of Mr. Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, executes orders placed by customers of Robinhood Markets Inc., TD Ameritrade and other online brokerages that have enjoyed surging volumes during the coronavirus pandemic.
Citadel Securities makes money by selling stocks or options for slightly more than it is willing to buy them. The difference is often just a fraction of a penny a share. But repeated millions of times a day, it adds up to serious money.
Last year, net trading revenue at Citadel Securities was $6.7 billion, almost double the previous high in 2018, a person familiar with the matter said.
Among the forces propelling that growth was an influx of newbie traders, many stuck at home due to Covid-19 lockdowns. Lured by easy-to-use trading apps and an industry shift toward zero-commission trades, individual investors opened more than 10 million new brokerage accounts in 2020, JMP Securities estimates.
Meanwhile, a thriving subculture of day traders grew in corners of the internet like Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, setting the stage for last week's manic trading in GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and several other popular stocks.
"This is the market that Ken Griffin and Citadel Securities have been waiting for," said Christopher Nagy, a former TD Ameritrade executive who is now a director of Healthy Markets Association, an investor group. "The last time the environment was this good for retail market makers was back in the dot-com bubble."
The firm drew scrutiny last week when its majority owner, Mr. Griffin, participated in a $2.75 billion emergency cash infusion into Melvin Capital Management, a short seller that was facing steep losses due to the huge rally in GameStop's stock.
The deal meant Citadel, the hedge-fund firm, was propping up a fund that had bet against GameStop stock, while Citadel Securities had been profiting from the order flow of small investors placing bullish bets on GameStop.
Citadel Securities says it is separately managed from the hedge-fund side of Mr. Griffin's business. The firm also released data showing that during the past week, retail orders pouring into its systems for GameStop were roughly balanced between buyers and sellers, casting doubt on the popular narrative that small investors drove the stock to its record close of $347.51 on Wednesday.
The data showed that 29% of GameStop trading volume Monday through Thursday was handled by Citadel Securities, underlining its huge role in the market for stocks popular with individual investors. Overall, about 41% of U.S. retail stock-trading volume goes through Citadel Securities, while the next-biggest player in the business, Virtu Financial Inc., has a market share of around 32%, the firms say.
"We witnessed an extraordinary level of retail trading last week," a Citadel Securities spokesperson said. "At many times over the course of the week, the large brokerage firms depended upon our capabilities to handle the deluge of orders."
Citadel Securities also accounts for a chunk of trading volume on public markets like the New York Stock Exchange as well as in options, futures, Treasurys and many markets overseas. Founded in 2002, the firm became a dominant player in electronic trading due to its technological prowess, quantitative skills and a hard-driving company culture. Rivals say it has grown increasingly tough to compete with Citadel Securities' scale and efficiency.
"They're really trying to take an Amazon approach to trading, where they try to squeeze out everyone else who's not on their scale," said Scott Knudsen, a former executive at rival trading firm IMC Financial Markets who now leads Cove Markets, a cryptocurrency-trading startup.
Citadel Securities' retail business has repeatedly drawn controversy. Like Virtu and other market makers, Citadel Securities pays brokerages for the right to trade against individual investors' orders. During the first three quarters of 2020, the firm made over $700 million in such payments to major online brokerages, according to Piper Sandler.
Critics say this practice, called payment for order flow, skews brokers' incentives so they seek to maximize revenue rather than ensure customers get the best price. Brokers and trading firms, including Citadel Securities, say payment for order flow benefits investors, because they get a better deal than if the orders were sent to the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Critics say this practice, called payment for order flow, skews brokers' incentives so they seek to maximize revenues rather than ensure customers get the best price. The practice is banned in some overseas markets, like the U.K. Earlier this month, former U.S. Sen. Carl Levin published an op-ed piece in the Financial Times urging the incoming Biden administration to ban payment for order flow, calling it "a conflicted practice that siphons billions out of U.S. investors' funds each year."
Brokers and trading firms, including Citadel Securities, say payment for order flow benefits investors, because they get a better deal than if the orders were sent to the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Citadel Securities says it saved individual investors a total of $1.3 billion last year by executing their orders at better prices than those available on exchanges.
The argument is that, in fact, both sides win: Citadel Securities can offer individual investors better prices on stocks than it would on an exchange, because it knows it's trading against a player too small to move the market. In contrast, when Citadel Securities trades on an exchange, it may end up trading with a fund manager that is driving a stock up or down with institutional-size purchases or sales—a situation that could result in losses for Citadel Securities.
Still, regulatory penalties have fueled suspicion about the firm's handing of individual investors' orders. In 2017, Citadel Securities paid $22.6 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it misled customers about providing the best price on investors' trades. Last year, the firm paid $700,000 to resolve claims by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that it traded ahead of customer orders in over-the-counter securities. In both cases, Citadel Securities didn't admit wrongdoing.

Full text: Our correspondents explain how retail investors are shaking Wall Street—and why they're not going away
In 2020 GameStop was a little-known video-game retailer. Its shares were worth a few dollars. By January 28th 2021 they peaked at over $480. The surge in value was seemingly down to amateur online traders who were on a mission to take on short-selling professionals. The frenzy around GameStop has rattled Wall Street, forced some online brokers to restrict trading and even raised concerns at the US Treasury. Our experts answer your questions on the ramifications for America’s stockmarket.

Full text: Outages and interruptions rattled investors using some of the largest online brokers on Wednesday.
Charles Schwab Corp., Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and several other online brokerages reported service disruptions, either to clients directly or on their social-media accounts. The new technical issues come after brokerage customers already encountered brief delays executing trades this week or temporarily lost access to vital account information.
The service disruptions have come during a period of frenetic trading , with shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. shooting wildly higher. The volatility has been largely driven by individual investors and unmoored to the fundamentals of the underlying companies. The rising prices have prompted bearish investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.
None of the brokerages commented on the reason for the issues. Some surprised customers by imposing new guardrails on trading.
On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade told customers that the firm was blocking some trades on GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and certain securities.
"We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors," read a notification to clients when they logged into their accounts.
Schwab, which recently bought TD Ameritrade but runs an independent brokerage for now, also restricted certain transactions in GameStop and other securities. "It is not uncommon for Charles Schwab to place restrictions on some transactions in certain securities in the interest of helping mitigate risk for our clients," a Schwab spokeswoman said.
Schwab clients have been barred since Jan. 13 from using GameStop as collateral for a margin loan.
More broadly, several of the firms have sent notices about the larger outages to customers.
"Due to a technical issue, some clients are experiencing issues with online trading. We're working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Please do not place trades again, as duplicate orders may be created. We apologize for any inconvenience," a notice on Charles Schwab's Twitter account read Wednesday morning. The firm told users on social media later in the day that "access has been restored to our platforms."
A spokeswoman for Fidelity said Wednesday it was "aware that some clients have experienced issues this morning and we are working on a resolution. We apologize for the inconvenience."
Later, the spokeswoman said the issue had been resolved, without elaborating.
A spokeswoman for Vanguard said: "We understand some Vanguard clients experienced difficulties accessing their accounts this morning. The issue has been resolved and we thank clients for their patience."
Individual investors have driven a surge in trading volumes for many online and retail-focused brokerages in the past year. Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities, said individual trading volume hit a record last year, with many brokers and wealth managers adding two or even three times as many new accounts as in 2019.
Still, most trading is controlled by institutional investors .
"These brokers are not systemically important players. They aren't critical to the functioning of markets. But they do speak to investor confidence," said Paul Rowady, director of research for market research and advisory firm Alphacution Research Conservatory.
David DeKok, 67, a nonfiction author who lives in Harrisburg, Pa., said that when tried to trade Monday on his Schwab account, he got a message that he entered the wrong ticker even though he hadn't. On Wednesday, he tried to sell out of an investment that was falling—and gave up after receiving that error message.
"I take it in stride," he said. "If this keeps happening, I'd consider changing platforms."
A Schwab spokeswoman said the company "will work with all clients to ensure their situations are made right."

Full text: Here's what we're watching ahead of Monday's opening bell.
—U.S. stock futures overall were little changed though technology shares charged higher ahead of a blockbuster week in earnings, with investors awaiting results from companies such as Apple, Tesla and Facebook.
Futures tied to the S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1% while contracts linked to the Nasdaq-100 advanced 0.9%.
What's Coming Up
—Earnings are due from Steel Dynamics and Hexcel after the close.
—The World Economic Forum holds a virtual summit this week. Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at 7 a.m. ET highlights today's agenda. Monday's panels include European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on restoring economic growth at 11 a.m., and Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey on digital currencies at 12 p.m.
—The Dallas Fed's manufacturing survey for January is out at 10:30 a.m.
Market Movers to Watch
—Gaming GameStop : Shares in videogame retailer, at the center of a tussle between internet message board day traders and hedge fund short sellers, are soaring 47% ahead of the bell, with more than a million shares changing hands.
—Shares of security software and services company BlackBerry jumped 39% premarket. The stock gained 43% last week following a report that it had settled a patent-royalty dispute with Facebook.
—Blank-check company TS Innovation Acquisitions rocketed 70% higher premarket. The Tishman Speyer-sponsored SPAC is merging with Latch in a deal that will take the maker of smart locks public.
—Moderna shares jumped 4.3% premarket after the vaccine producer said it was developing a coronavirus booster shot targeting a strain that was first identified in South Africa.
—Shares of consumer-products manufacturer Kimberly-Clark added 1.4% after it reported quarterly earnings Monday morning that beat forecasts.
—Merck shares slipped 1.3% premarket after it said Monday that it is halting development of its two experimental Covid-19 vaccines , after early clinical-trial data showed the shots generated disappointing immune responses against the virus.
—NCR shares gained 5.5% premarket. The company, formerly known as National Cash Register, is finalizing a takeover of Cardtronics that would value the ATM operator at $39 a share, or around $1.7 billion, outbidding a pair of investment firms that had earlier agreed to buy it. Cardtronics shares slipped 6%.

Bullish Stock Bets Explode as Major Indexes Repeatedly Set Records; Wagers tied to Tesla, Amazon, Apple and Nvidia were among the most popular wagers recently

Full text: Investors are piling into bets that will profit if stocks continue their record run.
Options activity is continuing at a breakneck pace in January, building on 2020's record volumes . It is the latest sign of optimism cresting through markets as individual and institutional investors pick up bullish options to profit from stock gains and abandon bearish wagers.
More than half a trillion dollars worth of options on individual stocks traded on Jan. 8 alone, the highest single-day level on record, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts in a Jan. 13 note.
Among the most popular bets were those tied to Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. And bullish call-options trading surged to a high on Jan. 14, with about 32 million contracts changing hands, according to data provider Trade Alert.
Options are contracts that give investors the right to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) shares, at specific prices, later in time. They are typically used to bet on stocks' direction or hedge portfolios. Although they can be risky to trade for amateur investors , activity has exploded in recent months. The interest has stemmed in part from investors looking to magnify gains in the stock market, since options allow them to put down a relatively small sum for the chance at an outsize return.
Many of these investors have flocked to online brokerages that have made it easier than ever to trade. Smaller options trades of just one contract—typically thought to stem from individual investors—recently made up almost a tenth of activity, up from 2% three years ago, according to Trade Alert data.
The robust trading comes as U.S. stocks have jumped to fresh highs. Earnings results have poured in over the past week, with companies such as Netflix Inc. and Goldman Sachs posting strong results. In the coming week, traders will be monitoring a slate of releases from big tech companies, with Microsoft Corp., Apple, Facebook Inc. and Tesla on deck.
Investors have also looked ahead to the prospect of fresh stimulus that would help the struggling economic recovery. In January, stocks have built on their big, and perhaps unexpected, gains of 2020: The S&P 500 has gained 2.3%, setting four closing highs, after rallying 16% last year. The stock-market rally has also broadened, lifting laggard sectors like financials and energy.
Ben Austin, a 21-year-old student at Syracuse University, said he has increased his positions in stocks such as American Express Co. and Citigroup Inc., in part because of the chance for more fiscal stimulus , which he thinks could boost spending.
"For the next couple months, I'm still kind of bullish on the market," Mr. Austin said. "I think we're going to see another giant stimulus package."
He started trading options in November and primarily trades calls to position for big events that have the potential to lift stocks, shying away from put options. He acknowledges that options can be riskier than stocks but relishes trading.
"There's somewhat of a thrill to the more risk aspect of it," Mr. Austin said. "There's way more potential for higher gains in a shorter amount of time."
As stocks have continued their ascent and bullish positions have flourished, many have ditched bearish bets on the market.
Short interest in one of the biggest exchange-traded funds tied to the S&P 500 recently hit the lowest level since March 2020, according to data from IHS Markit. Investors that short shares typically borrow stocks and sell them, in the hopes of buying them back later at a lower price before returning them to the lender. These positions profit when stocks tumble. And bearish put options outstanding tied to the gauge recently fell to the lowest level in at least four years, Trade Alert data show.
"This is the most popular I've seen call buying in my career," said Jon Cherry, global head of options at Northern Trust Capital Markets, who has been in the industry for more than two decades. "Where I think that is really driving from is kind of the melt-up that we've seen in broader markets."
Mr. Cherry said he has noticed interest in bullish positions as well as a desire to sell bearish options to juice income. Investors don't want to miss out on any potential stock-market gains to come and want to stay in positions that will profit if stocks keep soaring, he said.
Hayden Cole, 22, a student at the College of the Canyons in California, waded into stocks and options after he lost his job during the coronavirus pandemic. He started chatting with his father about the stock market.
"He told me the stock market always recovers. It'll always go back up," Mr. Cole said.
He said he bought shares of fuel-cell company Plug Power Inc., an exchange-traded fund tied to the S&P 500 and the ARK Innovation Exchange-Traded Fund, which tracks shares of companies such as Tesla and Roku Inc., in May. Lately, he has placed bullish options trades on companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Apple.
The S&P 500 has soared 36% since May, while the ARK fund has jumped 179%.
To some, the current environment is reminiscent of August , when stocks such as Tesla and Apple soared after their stock splits and a seemingly insatiable enthusiasm for stocks and options swept through the market, helping drive stocks to highs. The summer euphoria was followed by a 7.2% drop in the Nasdaq Composite in September.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in a Jan. 8 note that call-option buying was prominent among individual investors, based on an analysis of trading activity made up of fewer than 10 options contracts. This call buying could lead to a rise in volatility, driven by options hedging, they said.
And at times, overwhelming momentum in individual stocks such as GameStop Corp. has coincided with a surge in options activity. As the stock skyrocketed 51% on Friday, options activity tied to the company jumped to the highest level ever.
Options traders appear to be positioning for bigger gains for some of the sector's star performers ahead of their earnings reports this week. An options measure called skew, which measures the cost of bullish options relative to bearish ones, is near the lowest levels of the past year on stocks such as Apple, Advanced Micro Devices and Facebook, Trade Alert data show.
"People are always looking in the rearview mirror," said Joanne Hill, chief adviser for research at Cboe Vest, which oversees options-based strategies. "They're looking at the returns that had been achieved if they bought a call option on a stock six months ago."

Full text: The second week of March will be remembered as the one that saw the longest bull market on record end. The coronavirus epidemic morphed into a pandemic, businesses were left reeling, and investors were lost in a sea of red.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst one-day loss since Black Monday in 1987 . It is down 26% this year. U.S. crude oil is down 48% over the same period. Gold is up, but copper, a bellwether commodity, is down more than 11%. Treasury bond yields are actually up for the week, though too little to give equities investors any comfort.
It was a week of almost nothing but losers, but there were a few winners as well. Let's take a look.
Winner: Gas Companies
There are only a handful of companies whose shares are up over the past month, and the reason is obvious. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. is working on a possible coronavirus treatment.
For Campbell Soup Co., people working from home, or sick at home, will be eating at home. The same theory applies for Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.: Those at home will have more opportunity to play games.
Then there are the natural gas companies. You might think in a week that saw the oil market crater, there wouldn't be any winners anywhere in the energy industry. But shares of companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., Southwestern Energy Co. and EQT Corp. are rising.
Saudi Arabia's oil-price war is going to hurt U.S. oil companies. This is, somewhat ironically, good for natural gas companies.
Production of both oil and natural gas is expected to drop. But demand for natural gas isn't expected to fall. The result is likely to be a squeeze that would push prices higher. In the current state of world affairs, there are precious few industries that look to have pricing power.
EQT is up 18% this month, despite the worst equities selloff in more than a decade. Cabot is up 15%. Southwestern Energy is up more than 4%. Another natural gas producer, CNX Resources Corp., is down only 1%.

While the ultimate outcome of the oil-price fight isn't yet clear, "gas should be a safe(r) harbor than it is currently being valued," Bernstein analyst Jean Ann Salisbury wrote in a research note.
Loser: Managements
Just about everything and everybody in the market was a loser this week. The bull market is dead. Investors are being hit with wave after wave of selling. The corporate debt markets are roiling. The fears of a recession are climbing.
But there is one group that seems to be under acute pressure: management.
With companies scrambling to protect themselves from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, CEOs are under scrutiny.
Occidental Petroleum Corp. has been one of the hardest hit stocks in the S&P 500, down 64% this month alone. Damaged by the new price war in the oil market, the company was forced this week to cut both spending and dividends.
Now one of the company's most famous, and disgruntled, shareholders is coming after management. Carl Icahn ratcheted up his long-running fight with the company this week, disclosing that he now owns nearly 10% of the company's stock. With that position, he is demanding big changes: He wants to unseat the entire board and then get rid of Chief Executive Vicki Hollub.
Occidental isn't the only company fielding angry calls from its shareholders.
GameStop Corp. is under pressure from an investor group that owns about 7.5% of the company's shares. The group, which includes Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP, has been agitating for change for a year. They, too, are ramping up their campaign.
Even after GameStop appointed three new independent directors just this week, the group still wants its own representative on the board. They aren't happy with the company's performance and want their voices heard.
Elsewhere in C-suite news, United Parcel Service Inc. and Tupperware Brands Corp. both named new CEOs Thursday. Those are the latest in what has been a wave of change at corner offices since Robert Iger stepped down at Walt Disney Co. just over two weeks ago.
Next Week: Another Rate Cut?
There are very good reasons to question how much impact the Federal Reserve can have on the current situation. Even Fed officials have made the point. But they aren't powerless, which means the biggest event next week is the two-day meeting, March 17-18, of the Fed's rate-setting committee. On Wednesday, there will be a statement and a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell.
The market is betting heavily on another interest-rate cut. Look out, also, for any surprises, like Thursday's surprise liquidity announcement, between now and then.

Full text: The rising trend toward game downloads will hurt GameStop stock (GME), according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The firm reiterated its Underperform rating for GameStop stock on Friday, predicting the company will report earnings below expectations this fiscal year. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Curtis Nagle pointed to "earnings risk from the company's non-gaming segments," saying "we have grown more cautious on [GameStop's] core gaming business."
"We see increasing structural headwinds including digital penetration... increasing in-game transactions and content subscriptions," he wrote.
GameStop stock closed down 2.2% on Friday, to $14.73 per share. Its stock has declined 18% so far this year. Nagle reaffirmed his $10 price target for GameStop stock, representing 32% downside to its current price.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.
GameStop is the largest retailer of physical game software in the world, with roughly 3,800 stores in the U.S. and about 2,000 outlets in international markets.
Nagle cited research firm NPD's September report, which said that 46% of total videogame sales came from digital downloads, up nine percentage points from the previous year. He also said too many quality games are being released in a short time frame this holiday season, potentially hurting overall sales. Nagle estimated that GameStop will generate fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $2.87, versus the $3.00 Wall Street consensus.

Full text: Nintendo's latest videogame machine, the Nintendo Switch, is winning fans for both its lineup of popular games and its flexibility--it works as both a living-room console and a hand-held device.
But the real challenge for gamers has been actually getting their hands on it. Production isn't keeping up with demand in Japan, resulting in blockbuster queues and lotteries there. Over weekends in July and early August, tens of thousands of fans lined up at stores for a one-in-10 chance to buy the $300 console at events that have become a form of entertainment.
In the U.S. too, scarcity has only made the Switch more sought after. Some fans have spent months trying to find a Switch, and sellers on Amazon.com are getting $380 or more for a unit. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and GameStop Corp. said they have struggled to meet demand both in stores and online.
"We continue to see strong demand for the Switch and sell out our inventory in a matter of days of it being available in our stores and our websites," Tony Bartel, GameStop chief operating officer, said in a quarterly earnings call Thursday. "We believe that this will continue through the holiday."
Supply in Europe seems somewhat better, with electronics retailers' websites in France, Germany and Italy showing the console is available. In June, though, British videogame retailer Game Digital PLC issued a profit warning partly blaming lower-than-expected Switch supplies to the U.K.
Nintendo's official target is to ship 10 million Switch units in its current fiscal year ending in March 2018. People involved in the supply chain say they have been told to prepare for 18 million units. One executive in the supply chain said his company was ready to pick up the pace of production if asked.
"We're doing everything we can to make sure everyone who wants to buy a Nintendo Switch system can do so," Nintendo said in a statement. "We will ramp up production for the holiday period, which has been factored into our forecast."
One delicate balance for Nintendo: The more it tries to boost output quickly, the more it has to bow to the terms of parts makers, some of whom are also busy with orders for Apple Inc.'s next iPhone .
Nintendo's stock price is up more than 50% since the Switch went on sale March 3, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $45 billion.The scarcity of the Switch--whether by design or not--adds to the hype.
Aki Natsume, a 26-year-old singer, was one of more than 2,000 people a few weeks ago standing in line at the large Bic Camera store in Tokyo's Akihabara district for a chance to buy the Switch. She was there with a friend to make a video for YouTube about the hunt; she said her friend's YouTube channel has done well with clips of people trying to buy the machine.
Ms. Natsume got lucky--her number was one of 200 selected in the lottery. She bought a Switch, even though she said she wasn't particularly passionate about it. She already owns a rival console from Sony Corp. "I'm busy with playing a PlayStation 4 game."
Jimmy Niemczura, a 26-year-old in Youngstown, Ohio, said he nabbed one of only two Switch machines he saw for sale at his local Wal-Mart on July 31. Ever since March, he had been visiting major retailers near his home at least once a week without success. He said he signed up with several stores to be notified by email when new units arrived, but hadn't heard from any. "It was pretty frustrating," he said.
Earlier this month in Japan, electronics retailer Yamada Denki Co. apologized after acknowledging that a few of its salespeople were making what it called inappropriate demands on would-be Switch buyers: The customers were told that to get a Switch they had to buy a wireless router at the same time. The retailer said it has halted the practice.
Japan is Nintendo's second-largest market by revenue, accounting for 26% of sales. Nintendo sold more than 294,000 Switch units there in July, up from 129,971 in June, according to videogame publication Famitsu.
In Nintendo's Americas market, its largest, accounting for 43% of revenue, the company sold approximately 220,000 Switch consoles in July, up from about 215,000 in June, according to NPD Group.
People familiar with the supply chain say Nintendo is making progress working through shortages of key components, such as flash-memory chips and batteries. And it has overcome many of the challenges in assembling the machine's detachable, wireless controllers, which pack sensors and other delicate components into a small space. As a result, more players are making it to shelves, especially in Japan where Nintendo released the popular game "Splatoon 2" for the Switch in July.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each month's short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

Full text:   GameStop was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 at one stage on Monday after the US video game retailer reported weaker than expected third-quarter results, citing disappointing gaming software and hardware sales.
The Texas-based company said adjusted profits fell 11 per cent to $57m or 54 cents a share in the three months ended in October, shy of analysts' estimates for 59 cents a share. Revenues fell 3.6 per cent to $2bn, shy of forecasts.
New video game software sales, which accounted for almost a third of its revenue last year, fell 20.4 per cent.
Meanwhile, new hardware, which accounted for almost 22 per cent of its 2014 revenue, fell 9.3 per cent.
Retailers such as GameStop have been under pressure as consumers download games digitally at an increasing rate instead of buying physical versions.
This weighs on the retailer in two key ways, said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.
"GameStop does not have nearly as high market share in digital games than physical ones," he said. "This results in fewer trade-ins of used games, which generate much higher profit margins for GameStop than new ones."
For the current quarter, the company expects comparable sales in the range of -1 per cent to 6 per cent growth, compared with analysts' estimates for 4.3 per cent growth.
GameStop expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.12 to $2.32 a share, below expectations.
Shares in GameStop fell 15 per cent to $33.53 in early trading, taking the stock's year-to-date decline to 0.2 per cent. They later rallied to end down 4.2 per cent at $37.6.
Tyson Foods shares advanced 10.17 per cent to $48.09 after the US meat processor reported better than expected full-year earnings outlook and fourth quarter sales, driven by demand for its chicken and prepared foods products.
The Arkansas-based company said sales increased 4 per cent to $10.5bn in the fiscal fourth quarter, ahead of estimates.
Sales in chicken, Tyson's second-biggest division, climbed 8 per cent to $3bn, and in its prepared foods products to $2bn in the fourth quarter, buoyed by its acquisition of Hillshire Brands last year.
Operating profits climbed to $150m from a loss of $47m in the year ago period.
However, beef, Tyson's largest division, swung to an operating loss of $33m while sales slid modestly to $4.4bn.
Profits rose to $258m or 63 cents a share from $137m or 35 cents a share in the year-ago period but were below forecasts for earnings of 86 cents a share.
For fiscal 2016, the company forecast adjusted earnings in the range of $3.50 to $3.65 a share, ahead of expectations for $3.52.
Pfizer and Allergan shares were under pressure after they agreed to a $160bn tie-up, the largest merger in the pharmaceuticals industry.
Pfizer shares fell 2.7 per cent to $31.33 while shares in Allergan fell 3.6 per cent to $301.70.
Alcoa shares advanced 4.37 per cent to $9.07 after Elliott Management, the activist investor, revealed it had taken a stake in the aluminium producer.
The S&P 500 advanced early on Monday led by gains in the energy and material sectors, but ended down 0.12 per cent at 2,086.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.17 per cent to 17,792.68, and the Nasdaq Composite was almost flat at 5,102.48.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

Full text:   GameStop Corp. said its fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 25% as continued strong demand for Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox One and Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 4 led sales growth.
For the fiscal second quarter, the company forecast per-share earnings of 12 cents to 20 cents, mostly lower than estimates of 17 cents.
Same-store sales rose 5.8%, driven by continued demand for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 sales. Net sales in the new hardware category grew 81.1% to $438 million.
However, new software sales declined 20% as fewer triple-A titles were launched than a year earlier, but preowned/value software sales improved 5.3% as continuing trade-ins toward new consoles improved inventory levels.
For the period ended May 3, GameStop reported a profit of $68 million, or 59 cents a share, up from $54.6 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 7% to $2 billion.
The company expected per-share earnings of 55 cents to 60 cents on total sales growth of 7% to 10%.
GameStop has been tweaking its business model amid a slowdown in videogame sales. Last year's launch of Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox One have spurred sales for those devices, but sales of games for other consoles haven't been as strong.
The company also affirmed its fiscal-year earnings guidance.
The videogame retailer's shares rose 2.5% to $37.80 in recent after-hours trading, shortly after the financial results were released.

GameStop Investors Cheer Sony's Embrace of Used Games

Abstract: Hard-core gamers weren't the only ones cheering Sony Corp.'s announcement this week that its coming PlayStation 4 console would allow customers to play used videogames--so were investors in GameStop Corp. That's because GameStop, the world's largest specialty videogames retailer, gets almost half of its operating profit and a quarter of its revenue from buying used videogames and reselling them at a markup.

Full text:   Hard-core gamers weren't the only ones cheering Sony Corp.'s announcement this week that its coming PlayStation 4 console would allow customers to play used videogames--so were investors in GameStop Corp.
That's because GameStop, the world's largest specialty videogames retailer, gets almost half of its operating profit and a quarter of its revenue from buying used videogames and reselling them at a markup.
That source of income had seemed in peril, as analysts had hinted that new videogame consoles such as Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox One might prevent consumers from playing used games.
Investors understood the significance of Sony's Monday-evening announcement, sending GameStop shares up 7.8% to $37.72 in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The business model of the Grapevine, Texas, retailer, which operates more than 6,500 stores in 15 countries, may still be endangered in the long run, as gamers increasingly migrate to games downloaded digitally from the Internet and videogames played on mobile devices.
But Sony's unequivocal statement on used games means GameStop can at least wring more profits from this next cycle of videogame hardware.
GameStop representatives didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday. But GameStop Chief Executive Paul Raines recently touted the benefits of GameStop's business model, saying that by allowing gamers to trade in older hardware for credit at its stores, it can help drive sales of the pricey new game machines. The Xbox One will retail for $499, while the PlayStation 4 will cost $399.
"The amount of customers who will bring us electronics to buy a PS4 is going to be a big number," Mr. Raines said. "And all our console partners want a part of that, and they see the benefits of that."
While Sony clearly stated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles that PlayStation 4 wouldn't block used games--a hot-button topic with dedicated gamers--Microsoft unveiled its used-game policy for the Xbox One in decidedly murkier fashion.
Last week, Microsoft said it won't automatically block replay of used games on Xbox One, or take a cut of used-game sales, but would instead let publishers such as Electronic Arts Inc. and Activision Blizzard Inc. decide whether a title could be resold and whether to charge retailers a reactivation fee.
Such a fee could harm GameStop's business--not only reducing profits on each used game sold, but also cutting into the amount gamers receive when they trade in old titles, money they often use to purchase additional games.
Still, Microsoft's declaration that it wasn't barring used games was also seen by investors as a positive for GameStop, whose shares rose Friday after the announcement. The shares are up 50% so far this year.
GameStop pioneered the sale of used videogame consoles, cartridges and discs in an attempt to thwart the rapid decline in its business, but has struggled in recent quarters, reflecting an overall downward trend in console game purchases. Its sales fell 7% to $9 billion and it posted a loss of $270 million for the year ended Feb. 2.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

Abstract: June options expire Friday. [...] some of the trading on Tuesday consisted of short-term plays to capture the premium in a contract whose value was more than double the closing price at one point in Tuesday's session.

Shares in Best Buy and GameStop took a beating, but options traders appeared to make distinctions between the two companies.
Best Buy's stock fell $2.49, or 6.1%, to $38.56, as investors digested the company's lower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter profit and higher-than-expected spending.
The overall tone of options trading, however, was mixed, as traders picked up about 36,000 puts, conveying the right to sell shares, compared with 28,000 calls, giving the right to buy.
Traders showed interest in June $38 puts expiring Friday. At a price of 36 cents, the contract makes money if Best Buy shares dip under $37.64 before Friday.
But only some of the activity was to guard against or speculate on moves lower in the stock, said Frederic Ruffy, an analyst at WhatsTrading.com.
June options expire Friday. Thus, some of the trading on Tuesday consisted of short-term plays to capture the premium in a contract whose value was more than double the closing price at one point in Tuesday's session.
"You can get a lot of bang for your buck when trading very short-term options on a very volatile stock," Mr. Ruffy said.
Meanwhile, the tone in GameStop appeared to be more negative.
The stock fell $1.17, or 5.4%, to $20.71, after Best Buy said it will start selling used videogames, a move that likely means stepped-up competition for the videogame-software maker.
Options traders picked up 27,600 puts compared with 17,700 calls, according to Track Data.
Traders appeared to be gearing up for further drops this week, gravitating to puts that expire Friday.
Notable action occurred in $18, $19 and $20 contracts.
At a premium of 10 cents, the $19 contract makes money if GameStop shares decline to under $18.90 in the next few sessions.
Traders also made notable bullish moves on a day when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 2.4%, reflecting gains in energy and technology, and hopes for a stronger economic recovery.
Traders appeared to advance longer-dated bullish plays in insurance company Allstate, while also making optimistic trades in steelmaker AK Steel Holding.
In Allstate, a large investor executed big trades in two strikes apiece in the company's long-dated October and January call options at strike prices as high as $36 in what appeared to be call spreads, Mr. Ruffy said. In a call spread, an investor typically buys the contract with the lower strike price, sells the higher one and looks for bullish upside in the stock.
A trader executing a similar call spread in Allstate's January $35 and $36 calls at closing prices would pay the first contract's cost of $1 while pocketing the other's 81-cent premium, for a net cost of 19 cents. Allstate's shares rose 72 cents, or 2.4%, to $30.67.
In AK Steel, traders were active in $15 calls that expire in September and others expiring in December, said David Gompert, a senior market analyst at brokerage firm TradeMonster. At a premium of $1.52, the September contracts make money if AK Steel shares top $16.52 before the middle of that month. The stock rose 59 cents, or 4.2%, to $14.55.

Full text: TV-CARRIAGE PACT
Sinclair, Mediacom Renew
TV-Programming Rights
Cable operator Mediacom Communications Corp. and Sinclair Broadcasting Group Inc. signed a new 12-month agreement covering retransmission rights for TV programming, a day before an extension was set to expire.
About 700,000 Mediacom subscribers in Iowa and elsewhere in the Midwest were at risk of losing Sinclair programming if an agreement couldn't be reached. Sinclair wanted Mediacom to pay more to carry its stations.
Mediacom said the agreement covered retransmission rights for 22 television stations carried in its cable systems. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.
Separately, Mediacom agreed to drop its Federal Communications Commission complaint accusing Sinclair of not negotiating in good faith.
The agreement comes after Time Warner Cable Inc. and News Corp. reached a contract agreement last Friday that keeps the Fox broadcast network connected in Time Warner Cable homes.
News Corp. also owns The Wall Street Journal.

GENERAL MOTORS
Spyker Makes Revised Bid
To Buy Swedish Saab Unit
Spyker Cars NV of the Netherlands said Thursday it submitted a revised offer to General Motors Co. to acquire its Swedish brand Saab.
GM, however, has said the likelihood that Saab will survive is slim. Saab's board will meet Friday and is expected to begin the liquidation process, although the company could still opt to accept a last-minute offer.
GM has said it will look at any bids.
"We have continued a constructive dialogue with GM over the acquisition of Saab," Spyker CEO Victor Muller said in a statement. "We believe the Saab brand has lots of potential and would be keen to close a deal as quickly as possible."
GM Chief Executive Edward E. Whitacre Jr. on Wednesday told reporters that a deal to save Saab is unlikely.
Separately, GM said it plans to sell its Nexteer Automotive business, just three months after the company took over the maker of steering and driveline systems from supplier Delphi Corp.

GAMESTOP
Videogame Retailer Cuts
Profit Outlook in Surprise
GameStop Corp. slashed its fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings forecast as aggressive promotions by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. eroded results and raised fears that GameStop can't compete with the discount giant as well as hoped. The videogame retailer also said holiday sales were flat.
The results surprised investors, who had been expecting at least in-line numbers after GameStop issued an upbeat report in mid-December.
GameStop said Thursday that it expects earnings between $1.25 and $1.29 a share for its fiscal fourth quarter ending Jan. 30, compared with its November forecast of $1.47 to $1.65 a share.

GOOGLE
Search Giant Raises Bid
For On2 Technologies
Google Inc. raised its offer to acquire On2 Technologies Inc., bowing to pressure from On2 shareholders over its bid for the software company.
The new offer raises the value of the cash-and-stock deal to about $132 million, up from $106.5 million.
Google reached an agreement to buy the company in August. But On2 shareholders have balked at the price.

HUTCHISON
Offer of $545 Million
Made for Telecom Unit
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. has offered to take 60.4%-owned unit Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd. private for HK$2.20 a share, or up to HK$4.23 billion (US$545 million) in total, the companies said in a joint statement Friday.
The buyout plan comes after Hutchison Telecom sold off most of its major assets, leaving it with unprofitable businesses in various emerging markets.

FORBES
NYU Purchases Building
From Publisher Amid Woes
New York University has bought the Forbes building in Manhattan, the publishing company said, part of the Forbes family's efforts to offset steep advertising declines at its namesake magazine.
In the transaction, whose financial terms weren't disclosed, Forbes Media LLC will remain in the building as a tenant under a five-year leaseback agreement.
Like a number of other business magazines, Forbes has endured a difficult stretch.
The recession eroded advertising, and readers have migrated to the growing number of online sources for business news.
In the first nine months of 2009, the number of ad pages in Forbes fell more than 30% from a year earlier, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
The magazine has implemented several rounds of job cuts over the past year.

Biopure Corporation (Nasdaq: BPUR) is currently trading at .7379 per share up 1.04% on 488,940 volume while 381 trades have been placed. On Thursday August 23rd Biopure Corporation announced that the company submitted a draft clinical study protocol to the FDA for compassionate use of the investigational product Hemopure (HBOC- 201) in the United States. The proposed open label study would make Hemopure available to patients for the treatment of life threatening or potentially life threatening anemia on a compassionate use basis where blood transfusion is not an option. The product has been available for compassionate use since December 2006. Under the existing program the company evaluates individual requests from treating physicians for specific patients. If the patient is deemed an appropriate candidate for treatment, the FDA is contacted and a single patient IND is requested. To date the FDA has authorized shipment of Hemopure for 20 patients. Of the treated patients, four were experiencing severe anemia secondary to the management and treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. The balance of the compassionate use cases were for the treatment of blood loss resulting from surgical complications or trauma. The remaining patients who were not treated stabilized at the site by the time the drug was received. The draft protocol outlines general eligibility criteria that include the following: Severe, life threatening, or potentially life threatening anemia, Blood transfusion is not feasible, All alternative treatment options have been exhausted, Adult male or female - 18 years of age, or child with anemia secondary to severe burns. The safety, efficacy and pharmacology of Hemopure have been studied in 22 completed clinical trials. An additional four trials are ongoing. The clinical program was initially designed to evaluate Hemopure as a replacement for red blood cell transfusions, by providing an Oxygen Bridge(TM) in the setting of acute surgical anemia. More than 800 subjects have received HBOC- 201 and dosing ranged from 25g to 1230g of HBOC-201 administered over a period of up to eighteen days.
Biopure Corporation develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceuticals, called oxygen therapeutics, that are intravenously administered to deliver oxygen to the body's tissues. Hemopure [hemoglobin glutamer - 250 (bovine)], or HBOC-201, is approved for sale in South Africa for the treatment of surgical patients who are acutely anemic. Biopure has applied in the United Kingdom for regulatory approval of a proposed orthopedic surgical anemia indication. The company is developing Hemopure for a potential indication in cardiovascular ischemia, in addition to supporting the U.S. Navy's government- funded efforts to develop a potential out- of-hospital trauma indication. Biopure's veterinary product Oxyglobin [hemoglobin glutamer - 200 bovine)], or HBOC-301, the only oxygen therapeutic approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission, is indicated for the treatment of anemia in dogs. Biopure has sold approximately 186,000 units of Oxyglobin, which have been used to treat an estimated 100,000 animals.

We are pleased that we have received institutional support for our strategy and vision, and that we have eliminated debt from our balance sheet in favor of institutional ownership of our stock. Cornell's willingness to convert its debenture into a straight equity investment is a strong vote of confidence." The company and Cornell also cancelled several agreements relating to the previous debenture and canceled the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (SEDA).

Regulation SHO took effect January 3, 2005, and provides a new regulatory framework governing short selling of securities. It was designed with the objective of simplifying and modernizing short sale regulation and providing controls where they are most needed. At the conclusion of each settlement day, data is provided on securities in which: 1) there are at least 10,000 shares in aggregate failed deliveries for the security for five consecutive settlement days, and 2) these failures constitute at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. Regulation SHO mandates that, if a clearing agent has had a fail-to-deliver position for 13 consecutive settlement days, that clearing agent, and the broker/ dealer it clears for, must purchase securities to close out its fail to deliver position.
NeoRx (NASDAQ: NERX) is a cancer therapeutics development company.

About BUYINS.NET
WWW.BUYINS.NET is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight naked short selling. Naked short selling is the illegal act of short selling a stock when no affirmative determination has been made to locate shares of the stock to hypothecate in connection with the short sale. Buyins.net has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the naked short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted and naked shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short and naked short trades
