June 10 2020: GameStop Reports First Quarter Results
GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today reported sales and earnings for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020.
George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, "During this unprecedented time, our priority is focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and business partners as we continue the process of opening our stores as restrictions are lifted, in our ongoing effort to meet our customers' needs. We are proud of our team's ability to quickly adapt to meet the increased demand for our product offerings. As the pandemic spread, we leaned in on our upgraded omni-channel capabilities to fulfill customer orders through curbside pick-up where available, we reduced discretionary spending and enhanced our liquidity while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. While we delivered a loss for the quarter in total, our performance included total sales just shy of our original expectations, even as stores closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and key video game titles shifted to the second and third quarters, exacerbating the headwind from operating in the final stage of a console cycle. Even more impressive is that our e-commerce sales grew 519% in the first quarter and over 1,000% during the six weeks that our store base temporarily closed to customer access. We believe this reflects the loyalty of the GameStop customer and the confidence they place in us as their preferred place to shop."

Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation , the withdrawal deadline has passed and, accordingly, Existing Notes validly tendered in the Exchange Offer may no longer be withdrawn, except in limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law.

June 10: GameStop Reports First Quarter Results
GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today reported sales and earnings for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020.
George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, "During this unprecedented time, our priority is focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and business partners as we continue the process of opening our stores as restrictions are lifted, in our ongoing effort to meet our customers' needs. We are proud of our team's ability to quickly adapt to meet the increased demand for our product offerings. As the pandemic spread, we leaned in on our upgraded omni-channel capabilities to fulfill customer orders through curbside pick-up where available, we reduced discretionary spending and enhanced our liquidity while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. While we delivered a loss for the quarter in total, our performance included total sales just shy of our original expectations, even as stores closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and key video game titles shifted to the second and third quarters, exacerbating the headwind from operating in the final stage of a console cycle. Even more impressive is that our e-commerce sales grew 519% in the first quarter and over 1,000% during the six weeks that our store base temporarily closed to customer access. We believe this reflects the loyalty of the GameStop customer and the confidence they place in us as their preferred place to shop."

GRAPEVINE, Texas, June 04, 2020 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) ("the Company") today announced certain preliminary unaudited financial information for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020.

Despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, we are pleased to see our strategic investments in omni-channel capabilities allow us to deliver on the increased demand for gaming, entertainment and remote work products. Our Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities enabled many of our stores to safely open for contactless curbside pickup. Importantly, the U.S.-based stores conducting this limited curbside offering were able to meet or exceed their sales plans during the second half of the quarter which is a true testament to our ability to fully capitalize on both our omni-channel capabilities and our leadership position in gaming. I would like to thank all of our associates and business partners for their dedication and commitment during this unprecedented time. We have begun safely reopening our stores around the world as conditions and government regulations permit, and look forward to the day our fleet can be fully operational again. We believe we have, and are continuing to, take the appropriate steps to preserve liquidity, including disciplined management of all expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures as we continue to manage through the current environment, positioning the Company to emerge even stronger when in-store operations resume in totality."

April 21: GameStop Provides Business Update Related to COVID-19
GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 21, 2020 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced business updates related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
George Sherman, GameStop's Chief Executive Officer, said, "As we continue to navigate these unprecedented times, our priority has been and continues to be on the well-being of our employees, customers and business partners. I am very proud of the resilience that our teams are showing during this time. In very short order, we implemented a temporary curbside pick-up process at the majority of our U.S. stores in accordance with state and local ordinances. By using our omni-channel buy online pickup in store and ship from store capabilities, we are able to operate in a safe and regulatory compliant way while meeting the increased demand for our products as more consumers work, learn, and play from home. Importantly, since we closed stores to the public on March 22nd, through omni-channel fulfillment, we have retained over 90%1 of our planned sales volumes in the two-thirds of our stores that are conducting curbside operations. We believe this speaks to the strength of our enhanced omni-channel capabilities implemented in the fall of last year."
Mr. Sherman continued, "We continue to proactively manage our business with a goal to increase financial flexibility and preserve cash flow in the current environment. Today, we announced salary reductions for our senior management team and board of directors, as well as wage rate reductions for some other corporate and field support staff. In addition, we have offered certain corporate and other support team members the option to work under either half-time/half-pay structure or a temporary furlough program. We believe our aggressive focus on expense, inventory and capital expenditure reductions will help preserve our financial health as we work to ensure readiness and ramp up operations as soon as conditions allow."

Repurchased 22.6 Million Shares for $115.7 Million During the Quarter, Underscoring Commitment to Returning Capital to Shareholders
GRAPEVINE, Texas, Dec. 10, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today reported sales, earnings and share repurchase activity for the third quarter ended November 2, 2019, and issued updated guidance for fiscal 2019.
George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, "Our third quarter results continue to reflect the prevailing industry trends, most notably the unprecedented decline in new hardware sales seen across the market as the current generation of gaming consoles reach the end of their lifecycle and consumers delay their spending in anticipation of new hardware releases. With console makers set to introduce new and innovative gaming consoles late next year, we anticipate this trend to continue until the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite the current top-line trends, we are pleased with the continued strong progress that we are making against our strategic initiatives as we transform GameStop for the future. We remain on track to achieve our $200 million annualized operating profit improvement goal, by 2021 and we believe our strategic initiatives will enable to us to achieve our long-term growth and profit objectives as we fully leverage our unique leadership position and brand in the video game space."
Mr. Sherman continued, "Since July, we have repurchased more than one-third of our outstanding shares, underscoring our continued conviction in the long-term value proposition of GameStop, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and deliver positive cash flows, as well as our commitment of returning capital to shareholders."

August 28 2019: GameStop Kicks Off Wish Power Donation Campaign to Benefit Make-A-Wish with Live Wish Reveal
GRAPEVINE, Texas, Aug. 28, 2019 -- Avid Pokemon fan, 15-year-old Make-A-Wish kid Becca has dreamed of visiting the Pokemon headquarters in Japan since she was a little girl. Today, in front of more than 3,600 GameStop store managers, at the company's annual conference in Nashville, Tenn., Becca was told her wish is coming true. Becca's wish reveal serves as the kick-off for GameStop's annual fundraising campaign benefiting Make-A-Wish, which runs from August 28 - September 30 in stores nationwide and on gamestop.com. Funds raised during the campaign will help grant wishes for children battling critical illnesses, like Becca, during their greatest time of need.
This year's in-store donation campaign represents the 12th year of GameStop's financial support for Make-A-Wish, and comes on the heels of GameStop achieving its goal set four years ago to increase its overall charitable impact on the community by raising $20 million for various charities by 2020.
"Today has been a day of good news. We not only told Becca her wish to go to the Pokemon headquarters is coming true, but we also shared with our associates that we have raised $20 million for charitable causes four months earlier than planned and will continue to give back," said Frank Hamlin, executive vice president and chief customer officer for GameStop. "We are going to raise as much as we can together to help Make-A-Wish fulfill life-changing wishes."

July 15 2019: GameStop Doubles-Down on Retail Innovation, Partners with R/GA to Re-Design the Future of the Cultural Gaming Experience
GRAPEVINE, Texas, July 15, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today announced a strategic partnership with global innovation design firm, R/GA, to strengthen its focus on creating unique in-store experiences as part of its strategic move in re-affirming its place in the video gaming culture.
The partnership with R/GA's Austin and Chicago teams is part of GameStop's broader business transformation strategy to evolve its efforts in cultivating innovative customer-centric opportunities to bring video game culture to life in every neighborhood. GameStop's renewed customer-first focus stems from qualitative and quantitative research led by GameStop and R/GA that identified four major motivations gaming fans have for playing video games - immersion, achievement, creativity and community.
Together, GameStop and R/GA are developing and piloting new and streamlined physical store concepts, introducing new ways for gamers to try new titles before they buy them, and giving stores a unique layout and purpose that appeal to gamers. From store concepts that offer competitive sessions in home-grown e-Leagues to locations that sell strictly retro gaming software and hardware, GameStop will pilot the new store concepts in a select market to present something new to players both old and new, and searching for experiences in gaming beyond the console.
"We're on a journey to use our vast retail footprint to provide an engaging and well-thought-out experience that enhances our consumers' gaming interests. Among its many strengths is R/GA's ability to leverage consumer insights and technology to reimagine the experience our consumers can have in our physical space. Our investment in this partnership is the next stage of our transformation and growth strategy," said Frank Hamlin, Chief Customer Officer at GameStop.

GRAPEVINE, Texas, May 30, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced new leadership appointments and an enhanced organizational structure to better position the company for continued execution of its transformation and drive its next phase of growth. Under the enhanced organizational structure, which includes newly created Chief Customer Officer and Chief Merchandising Officer roles, the leadership team will report directly to George Sherman, who was appointed as Chief Executive Officer last month.
Collectively, the additions and changes to GameStop's leadership bring together a strong group of individuals with complementary experience, deep industry and operational expertise and proven records of execution. These include:
"The new leadership appointments and changes to our organizational structure mark important milestones that will help advance GameStop's transformation as we work to position the company for the future and bring gaming culture and experiences to life in every community," George said. "With this experienced and dynamic team in place, we will be better positioned than ever to execute on our strategic priorities and meet our loyal customers where, when and how they want to shop. Importantly, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and profitability and further strengthening our balance sheet to deliver increased value to our shareholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders."
George added, "On behalf of the entire GameStop Board of Directors and leadership team, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Rob for his significant contributions to GameStop in his nearly 23-year career with the company. Rob helped transform GameStop from a retail-only, single focus retailer to an omni-channel enterprise with multiple retail brands and product sets.

11.2.6 Performance
July 15: GameStop Announces Final Results of its Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer
GRAPEVINE, Texas, July 15, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced the final results of its "modified Dutch auction" tender offer to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The tender offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 10, 2019.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer and based on the final count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, GameStop accepted for payment, at a purchase price of $5.20 per share, a total of 12,000,000 shares properly tendered at the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of $62,400,000, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. GameStop accepted the shares on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of "odd lots," which were accepted in full, and conditional tenders that were automatically regarded as withdrawn because the condition of the tender was not met, and has been informed by the depositary that the final proration factor for the tender offer is 43.14%. The shares purchased represent approximately 11.72% of GameStop's Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of July 10, 2019.
The depositary will promptly pay for all shares accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer, and will return to the tendering shareholders all other shares tendered and not purchased.
While GameStop suspended open market repurchase activity under its existing share repurchase program initiated in March 2019, the completion of the tender offer removes that suspension. However, under applicable securities laws, GameStop may not repurchase any shares until July 25, 2019. After taking into account the completion of the tender offer, the company has $237,600,000 repurchase capacity remaining under the share repurchase program.

July 11: GameStop Announces Preliminary Results of its Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer
GRAPEVINE, Texas, July 11, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced the preliminary results of its "modified Dutch auction" tender offer to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The tender offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 10, 2019.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer and based on the preliminary count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, GameStop expects to accept for payment, at a purchase price of $5.20, a total of 12,000,000 shares properly tendered at the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of approximately $62,400,000, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. GameStop expects to accept the shares on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of "odd lots," which will be accepted in full and conditional tenders that will automatically be regarded as withdrawn because the condition of the tender has not been met, and has been informed by the depositary that the preliminary proration factor for the tender offer is approximately 41.3%. The shares expected to be purchased represent approximately 11.72% of GameStop's Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of July 10, 2019.
The number of shares expected to be purchased in the tender offer, the price per share, total purchase price and the proration factor are based on the assumption that all shares tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery will be delivered within the prescribed two trading day settlement period. The final number of shares to be purchased, the final price per share, final total purchase price and the final proration factor will be announced following the expiration of the guaranteed delivery period and the completion by the depositary of the confirmation process.

Together, GameStop and R/GA are developing and piloting new and streamlined physical store concepts, introducing new ways for gamers to try new titles before they buy them, and giving stores a unique layout and purpose that appeal to gamers. From store concepts that offer competitive sessions in home-grown e-Leagues to locations that sell strictly retro gaming software and hardware, GameStop will pilot the new store concepts in a select market to present something new to players both old and new, and searching for experiences in gaming beyond the console.
"We're on a journey to use our vast retail footprint to provide an engaging and well-thought-out experience that enhances our consumers' gaming interests. Among its many strengths is R/GA's ability to leverage consumer insights and technology to reimagine the experience our consumers can have in our physical space. Our investment in this partnership is the next stage of our transformation and growth strategy," said Frank Hamlin, Chief Customer Officer at GameStop.

April 05: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

(NYSE: GME) today announced that it has reached a cooperation agreement with Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP ("Permit") under which two new independent directors will be added to the GameStop Board of Directors. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the Company will appoint an independent director from among the candidates nominated by Hestia and Permit. As part of the Board's ongoing refreshment and search efforts, the Board will appoint an additional independent director who will be selected by the Board in consultation with Hestia and Permit. It is anticipated that the two new directors will join the Board on or before April 30, 2019.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two new independent directors will be included in the Company's slate of directors standing for election at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The director nominated by Hestia and Permit will join the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees upon election. Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the GameStop Board will comprise 11 directors, nine of whom are independent.
Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Hestia and Permit have agreed to withdraw their director nominations for GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting, effective as of the date of the appointment of one of their nominees.

March 29: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today confirmed that Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia"), which owns approximately 160,000 shares of GameStop common stock, provided notice of its intent to nominate four individuals to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

GameStop Accepting Donations Nationwide During World Autism Month
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop Gives partnered with PowerA to create a limited-edition Xbox One wired controller to support the understanding, acceptance and inclusion of people with autism spectrum disorder. Releasing on March 31, this Only at GameStop controller designed by PowerA will help raise funds in support of autism awareness.
PowerA Design Manager, Brandon Smith's personal experience raising a young son with autism and interacting with friends and families within the autism community influenced the design of the controller. With each purchase of the controller, GameStop Gives will donate a portion of the profits to the nonPareil Institute to help teach adults with autism digital technology skills in various domains and work toward building games and items for the digital marketplace. One of the games developed by nonPareil Institute Crew, To Catch A Monkey, will also be provided for free with each purchase of the GameStop Gives controller.
"GameStop is committed to supporting the autism community and spreading the power of gaming for good. We hope the powerful message behind the development and design of this unique controller resonates and makes the end-user feel good about gaming and its ability to be inclusive," said Eric Bright, VP of merchandising at GameStop.
The GameStop Gives controller release coincides with GameStop's fourth annual Autism Awareness Campaign that starts March 29 and runs through April 30. GameStop will be taking donations at checkout to benefit Autism Speaks and its NXT GEN Coders Program, and nonPareil Institute. Last year's fundraising campaign launched the NXT GEN Coders Program powered by GameStop, which awarded $250,000 in grants to 14 organizations from coast to coast.

March 28: GameStop Earns Top Marks in 2019 Corporate Equality Index; Yielding a Perfect Scorecard on The Annual LGBTQ Workplace Survey
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop is proud to announce that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. This represents the eighth consecutive year the company has been awarded a perfect score in the annual workplace survey.
"The top-scoring companies on this year's CEI are not only establishing policies that affirm and include employees here in the United States, they are applying these policies to their global operations and impacting millions of people beyond our shores," said HRC President Chad Griffin. "Many of these companies have also become vocal advocates for equality in the public square, including the dozens that have signed on to amicus briefs in vital Supreme Court cases and the more than 170 that have joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests. It's important to our organization that we celebrate the quality and individuality of every person we serve in and out of our organization."
The 2019 CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community.

March 28: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

The tender offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 10, 2019.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer and based on the preliminary count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, GameStop expects to accept for payment, at a purchase price of $5.20, a total of 12,000,000 shares properly tendered at the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of approximately $62,400,000, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. GameStop expects to accept the shares on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of "odd lots," which will be accepted in full and conditional tenders that will automatically be regarded as withdrawn because the condition of the tender has not been met, and has been informed by the depositary that the preliminary proration factor for the tender offer is approximately 41.3%. The shares expected to be purchased represent approximately 11.72% of GameStop's Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of July 10, 2019.
The number of shares expected to be purchased in the tender offer, the price per share, total purchase price and the proration factor are based on the assumption that all shares tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery will be delivered within the prescribed two trading day settlement period. The final number of shares to be purchased, the final price per share, final total purchase price and the final proration factor will be announced following the expiration of the guaranteed delivery period and the completion by the depositary of the confirmation process.

April 15: GameStop Reports Inducement Awards Under NYSE Rule 303A.08
GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 15, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) announced the issuance today of restricted stock awards to George Sherman, its new Chief Executive Officer. Consistent with the disclosures contained in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2019, these awards were issued to induce Mr. Sherman to enter into employment with GameStop and were issued outside of GameStop's stockholder approved equity incentive plan, in reliance on the inducement award exception contained in NYSE Listing Rule 303A.08. GameStop is issuing this press release pursuant to NYSE Listing Rule 303A.08.
The awards to Mr. Sherman consist of 587,249 shares of time-based restricted stock and 587,248 shares of performance-based restricted stock. The 587,248 shares of performance-based restricted stock represent the number of shares that would be earned at target levels of performance (the "Target Shares"). The actual number of shares that may be earned in respect of the performance-based portion of the awards will vary between 0 to 200% of the Target Shares, depending on actual performance, with any above-target shares being issued at the time that performance is determined.
The inducement awards were made outside of GameStop's Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Plan, but have terms generally consistent with the relevant terms of that plan. The time-based portion of the awards will vest in three equal annual installments, on the first, second and third anniversaries of today (the "Grant Date"), subject to Mr. Sherman's continuous service with GameStop through the applicable vesting date. The performance goals applicable to the performance-based portion of the awards have not yet been determined. Those goals will be established at the same time as, and will be substantially the same as, the performance goals that will be applicable to 2019 annual equity awards issued to GameStop's other named executive officers.

April 05: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

April 01: GameStop Announces Agreement with Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise Capital Partners
Two New Independent Directors to Join GameStop Board of Directors
GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 01, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced that it has reached a cooperation agreement with Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP ("Permit") under which two new independent directors will be added to the GameStop Board of Directors. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the Company will appoint an independent director from among the candidates nominated by Hestia and Permit. As part of the Board's ongoing refreshment and search efforts, the Board will appoint an additional independent director who will be selected by the Board in consultation with Hestia and Permit. It is anticipated that the two new directors will join the Board on or before April 30, 2019.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two new independent directors will be included in the Company's slate of directors standing for election at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The director nominated by Hestia and Permit will join the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees upon election. Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the GameStop Board will comprise 11 directors, nine of whom are independent.
Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Hestia and Permit have agreed to withdraw their director nominations for GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting, effective as of the date of the appointment of one of their nominees.

March 29: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today confirmed that Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia"), which owns approximately 160,000 shares of GameStop common stock, provided notice of its intent to nominate four individuals to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

GameStop Accepting Donations Nationwide During World Autism Month
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop Gives partnered with PowerA to create a limited-edition Xbox One wired controller to support the understanding, acceptance and inclusion of people with autism spectrum disorder. Releasing on March 31, this Only at GameStop controller designed by PowerA will help raise funds in support of autism awareness.
PowerA Design Manager, Brandon Smith's personal experience raising a young son with autism and interacting with friends and families within the autism community influenced the design of the controller. With each purchase of the controller, GameStop Gives will donate a portion of the profits to the nonPareil Institute to help teach adults with autism digital technology skills in various domains and work toward building games and items for the digital marketplace. One of the games developed by nonPareil Institute Crew, To Catch A Monkey, will also be provided for free with each purchase of the GameStop Gives controller.
"GameStop is committed to supporting the autism community and spreading the power of gaming for good. We hope the powerful message behind the development and design of this unique controller resonates and makes the end-user feel good about gaming and its ability to be inclusive," said Eric Bright, VP of merchandising at GameStop.

GameStop will be taking donations at checkout to benefit Autism Speaks and its NXT GEN Coders Program, and nonPareil Institute. Last year's fundraising campaign launched the NXT GEN Coders Program powered by GameStop, which awarded $250,000 in grants to 14 organizations from coast to coast.

March 28: GameStop Earns Top Marks in 2019 Corporate Equality Index; Yielding a Perfect Scorecard on The Annual LGBTQ Workplace Survey
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop is proud to announce that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. This represents the eighth consecutive year the company has been awarded a perfect score in the annual workplace survey.
"The top-scoring companies on this year's CEI are not only establishing policies that affirm and include employees here in the United States, they are applying these policies to their global operations and impacting millions of people beyond our shores," said HRC President Chad Griffin. "Many of these companies have also become vocal advocates for equality in the public square, including the dozens that have signed on to amicus briefs in vital Supreme Court cases and the more than 170 that have joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests. It's important to our organization that we celebrate the quality and individuality of every person we serve in and out of our organization."
The 2019 CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community.

March 28: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

What happened
Shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) fell 13.6% Friday after the video game retailer followed mixed fiscal-fourth-quarter 2016 results with disappointing forward guidance. So what
GameStop's quarterly revenue fell 13.6% year over year, to $3.05 billion, driven by weak sales of certain AAA (high-budget, high-promotion) game titles and aggressive Thanksgiving and Black Friday console promotions by competitors. GameStop also saw consolidated comparable-store sales fall 16.3%, including a 20.8% drop in the U.S. and 4.6% declines internationally. On the bottom line, that translated to a 3.1% decline in adjusted net income, to $243.8 million, or $2.38 per diluted share. By comparison, analysts' consensus estimates called for lower adjusted earnings of $2.29 per share on higher revenue of $3.1 billion.
Image source: GameStop via Business Wire. Now what
Note that GameStop bolstered its per-share earnings by repurchasing 1.66 million shares last quarter for $39.1 million, bringing full-year repurchases to 3.01 million shares for $75.1 million. That leaves $170.2 million remaining under GameStop's existing repurchase authorization. What's more, as you may recall, earlier this month the company boosted its regular annual cash dividend by 2.7%, to $1.52 per share.
Looking forward, however, GameStop CFO Rob Lloyd also told investors the company will no longer provide earnings or same-store sales guidance on a quarterly basis. Instead, GameStop will offer updates to its annual outlook with the hope of "[reducing] investor distraction as we continue to diversify the company and seek to maximize long-term shareholder value."
GameStop anticipates revenue for the full fiscal year of 2017 to be in the range of down 2% to up 2% from $8.61 billion in fiscal 2016, including a flat to negative 5% change in comparable-store sales. That should result in net income of $320 million to $354 million, or $3.10 per share to $3.40 per share. By comparison, Wall Street was modeling fiscal 2017 revenue of $8.68 billion, and earnings of $3.73 per share.
In the end, it's hard to blame GameStop management for wanting to shift investors' focus toward their longer-term targets, especially given volatility in today's difficult retail environment. But considering those longer-term targets fell well short of the numbers for which investors had hoped, it's no surprise to see GameStop stock trading down today.

GameStop Corp. Projects a Profit Decline in 2017

GameStop (NYSE: GME) this week announced quarterly results for the key holiday shopping period that, as expected, included sharp declines in its core video game business. The specialty retailer managed a few important wins, including improved profitability and spiking revenue from divisions that exist outside of the slumping video game segment. Yet management also issued a conservative profit outlook for the year ahead.
More on that forecast in a moment. First, here's how the headline fourth-quarter results stacked up against the prior-year period:
Metric
Q4 2016
Q4 2015
Change
Revenue
$3.05 billion
$3.53 billion
(13.6%)
Net income
$209 million
$249 million
(16.1%)
Earnings per share
$2.04
$2.38
(14.3%)
Data source: GameStop's financial filing. What happened this quarter?
Overall sales dipped 14% as a big decline in comparable-store sales was partially offset by rising demand in the technology brands segment that houses GameStop's consumer electronics business.
Image source: Getty Images.
Other highlights of the quarter include: Comparable-store sales fell 16%, which was near the lower end of management's January guidance that called for declines of between 16% and 18%. GameStop suffered from weak demand for major game releases as well as significant pricing pressure as rivals offered huge discounts on gaming consoles through the holiday season crush. The profitable pre-owned software business fared relatively well, falling 7%. The tech brands segment rose 44% to $256 million. Collectibles, GameStop's other promising new business line, jumped 28% to $212 million. Overall, sales from non-physical gaming segments increased to 37% of sales from 25% a year ago. Gross profit margin jumped to 33% of sales from 30%, and that growth ensured that the company generated the same $1 billion of gross profit that it produced on a larger revenue base last year. Asset impairment charges tied to the closing of a few underperforming tech brands stores, plus higher overall expenses, pushed net income lower as net margin ticked down to 6.9% of sales from 7%. What management had to say
"GameStop's transformation continued to take hold in 2016," CEO Paul Raines said in a press release, "as our non-gaming businesses drove gross margin expansion and significantly contributed to our profits."
On the other hand, "the video game category was weak, particularly in the back half of 2016, as the console cycle ages," Rains explained. "Looking at 2017, Technology Brands and Collectibles are expected to generate another year of strong growth, and new hardware innovation in the video game category looks promising." Looking forward
Rains and his executive team plan to keep emphasizing the retailer's healthy business lines this year while cutting costs and trimming down its portfolio of stores. To that end, they see the tech brands segment growing by 20% to at least $120 million in 2017. Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.
Overall revenue is projected to be flat to mark a solid improvement over this past year's 8% drop. Net income will likely end between $320 million and $354 million, which would be a second straight year of declines following 2015's record $400 million haul. That result would leave the 6% dividend yield well covered at less than 50% of earnings.
But whether the company reaches that $400 million profit mark again will depend on the severity of the pullback in physical game retailing, and on GameStop's ability to take advantage of complementary selling opportunities like the consumer products and collectibles segments that have protected profitability as its core industry shrinks. Either way, it promises to be a bumpy ride for shareholders. In announcing its plan to discontinue offering quarterly forecasts on comparable-store sales, GameStop argued that these results are distracting to investors since they "can be volatile given the current business environment."

3 Gaming Stocks That Are Better Bets Than Gamestop Corp.

Image source: Gamestop
GameStop (NYSE: GME), the brick-and-mortar video games and gaming hardware seller, has struggled in recent years in the face of a retail industry that is increasingly moving online and a new delivery model for gaming content is leading to more of it being purchased and downloaded directly through internet-connected consoles. GameStop stock certainly has some attractive aspects, including a dividend yield of more than 6% and a price to earnings ratio of just 6. Still, there's a reason for this low valuation. The company expects to see same-store sales continue their decline, and fall by as much as 7% in its third quarter.  
Video game fans continue to want the newest technology and on-demand content, so the long-term gains in this industry are likely to come from the content creators and actual hardware innovators. Given that insight, here are three stocks in the industry that look better than GameStop today. 
Company
Market Cap 
P/E 
Gaming Industry Growth Thesis
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI)
$29 billion
33
Top content and online gaming growth, strong sales growth 
Electronic Arts  (NASDAQ: EA)
$23 billion
19
Less impressive sales growth, but much cheaper than Activision
NVIDIA  (NASDAQ: NVDA)
$45 billion
43
Top chipmaker powering gaming growth, with diversified revenue streams
Data source: Yahoo! Finance
After an incredible start to 2016, Activision Blizzard shares lost about 10% of their value following the company's Q3 earnings report, which showed an incredible 58% jump in revenue year over year, but which also featured a lighter-than-expected Q4 forecast -- even though it was revised up. This small dip could be a great chance to buy into this growth stock at a discount.    
During the third quarter, Activision posted earnings of $0.26 per share, up 53% year over year. The growth in sales and earnings was helped by a 50% increase in monthly active users, and great reaction to new releases like Overwatch , a game that launched in May, but continued to surge through Q2 and Q3, especially with huge growth in China. 
Other than new games and more users, Activision has also been incredibly successful with its increased emphasis on in-game purchases and subscription content, which allow titles to bring in fresh revenue long after the game is purchased. Product sales in the quarter were actually down year over year, but subscription, licensing and other revenues more than doubled, which drove overall sales growth. 
Image source: Electronic Arts
Activision's largest competitor, Electronic Arts, also has some winning game titles, such as its Star Wars Battlefront series, which has produced big growth so far in 2016, and shows promise for future growth as more movies in the franchise come out. While EA's sales growth has been less impressive than Activision's -- up 8% year over year in the recently reported fiscal Q2 2017  -- it was better than analysts expected, and it still looks as if it has plenty of potential to grow. Its loss per share was smaller than expected at $0.13, and adjusted EPS was $0.53, far ahead of analysts' expectations.  
Adding to the stock's attractiveness, it trades at just 19 times earnings --  nearly half the P/E ratio of Activision. For the second half of its fiscal 2017, EA has said that it is focusing on improving gross margin to 71% for the year, up from 69% in Q2, meaning that profits could begin rising even faster in the quarters to come. That undervalued earnings growth could make this look like an even better entry point. 
Image source: Nvidia
The content produced by companies like Activision and EA, combined with new hardware and gaming console technology, creates a stunning overall experience for players. Powering those graphics and gameplay on the backend are the circuit boards and chips, such as those made by NVIDIA .
NVIDIA has been one of the pioneers in this space, and already works with the biggest gaming companies like Activision and EA, as well as computer and gaming hardware companies that use NVIDIA's chips in their consoles. Its most important product line could be its Pascal chips, released this summer, that will help make many more mass-market laptops virtual reality ready. Those components mean the company could one of the biggest winners of a VR industry that Digi-Capital analysts expect could reach $120 billion by 2020. 
Beyond gaming, NVIDIA is deeply involved in the automotive industry's push toward autonomous driving, and is exposed to other high-growth sectors. The stock has gained more than 170% in the past 12 months, thanks to its incredible growth in sales and earnings, which were up 54% and 89% year over year, respectively, last quarter. NVIDIA is by far the most expensive stock in the group, trading at a P/E of 43, but it could also be the highest growth company of the three, and it has plenty of diversification.  
Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than GameStop

One companyhas been completely left out of the video game industry's recent upturn. The two biggest publishers, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts , each posted better than 200% returns over the last five years. And yet GameStop (NYSE: GME), which dominates the retailing side of the industry, hasn't budged in that time.
The stock is down 40% in just the last year as investors worry that its growth prospects will disappear thanks to shifting industry dynamics, especially the move toward digital downloads.
GameStop has plenty going for it, though. With profit margins and net income at an all-time high, it's clear that management was right to push into complementary business lines like consumer tech years ago. In addition, income investors currently have no reason to worry about GameStop can cover its unusually high 6% dividend yield.
Still, shareholders who've endured the latest slump might consider selling their stock if the growth forecast takes another step down or if the recent profitability gains begin to evaporate.
GameStop missed its latest revenue growth estimate by a wide margin. Sales at existing locations dove by 11%, compared to the 4% to 7% decline range that CEO Paul Raines and his team had forecast. Executives knew that growth would be hard to come by given the big game releases in the prior-year period ( Batman: Arkham Knight and Elder Scrolls Online ) would not see comparable launches this time around.

What GameStop didn't foresee was the depressing effect that new video game device details would have on its business. The company endured a 35% plunge in video game hardware sales as device makers released fresh details on their upcoming console launches that convinced gamers to hold off on major new purchases.
Management's updated guidance implies that the slump won't last for long, as comps are forecast to be roughly flat in its fiscal third quarter. GameStop now sees full-year comps declining by 3%, versus the 2% dip they had originally projected. Another wide miss in that forecast, though, might mean the retailer has more fundamental demand and customer traffic issues to deal with. Additionally, back-to-back outlook downgrades would confirm that Raines and his executive team don't have a good reading on the industry, which won't inspire investor confidence heading into the crucial holiday shopping season.
GameStop can't do much about shifting game release calendars or the launch plans of console makers, but it does have control over where it chooses to expand. So far, its decisions in that regard have been great for the business. Gross profit margin soared to a new high last quarter -- 38% of sales from 33% last year -- as the consumer tech and collectibles segments posted outsized growth.

Raines argued that this was all according to executives' plan. "These new businesses offset a tough quarter for video gaming and prove that our diversification strategy is succeeding," he said in a press release.
The growth categories carry much higher margins than game hardware, GameStop's least profitable product category. And so the trade-off is one that management is happy to make. It's also a key reason why the company reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook that calls for record profits even as the sales forecast was ratcheted back.
GameStop aims to keep its revenue roughly flat while improving overall profitability and earning power as the core video game business fades in importance. Investors who buy into that risky long-term vision get a chance at strong profit growth ahead with the current payoff of a well-protected dividend. With its core industry undergoing huge changes, though, investors should watch closely for signs that this thesis is falling apart.

What: Shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) fell 10.6% Friday after the specialty gaming retailer announced weaker-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2016 results.
So what: Quarterly revenue fell 7.4% year over year, to $1.63 billion, driven by a 10.6% decline in consolidated comparable-store sales. GameStop noted that video game sales were hurt by a lack of new titles compared to those launched in the same year-ago period, while hardware sales fell as buyers held off due to new information released about upcoming gaming consoles.
On the bottom line, that translated to a 15.7% decline in adjusted net income, to $27.9 million, and a 12.9% drop in adjusted net income per share, to $0.27.
GameStop CEO Paul Raines added:
As expected, the continued growth and increased profit contribution of our non-physical gaming businesses drove our second-quarter results. Tech Brands sales grew more than 50%, omni-channel sales increased 16%, Collectibles sales more than doubled and year to date, more than half ofGameStop'soperating earnings have come from non-physical gaming categories. These new businesses offset a tough quarter for video gaming and prove that our diversification strategy is succeeding.
While net income arrived within GameStop's guidance range (provided last quarter) for earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.30, that guidance also called for a less-severe comparable-store sales decline in the range of 7% to 4%.
Now what: In addition, for the current quarter, GameStop anticipates comparable-store sales to range from negative 2% to growth of 1%, with diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.53 to $0.58. Finally, GameStop reiterated its previous guidance for full-year diluted earnings per share of $3.90 to $4.05, but also reduced its expectations for comparable-store sales, which are now expected to decline in the range of 4.5% to 1.5% (compared to previous guidance for comps to be in the range of negative 3% to flat as compared to 2015).
That's not to say GameStop's results were overwhelmingly negative. And investors can take some solace knowing its efforts to diversify are proving effective in combating today's difficult environment for video gaming. But in the end, considering GameStop's comps are still sliding to a greater degree than anticipated, it's no surprise to see the market bidding GameStop stock down today.

Specialty retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME) announced quarterly results this week that reflected a difficult sales environment in its core video game market. Growth accelerated in its emerging business lines such as consumer tech and mobile services. However, that success was overshadowed by a sharply weaker retail gaming division.
Here's how the headline results stacked up against the prior-year period:
Metric
Q2 2016 Actuals
Q2 2015 Actuals
Growth
Revenue
$1.63 billion
$1.76 billion
(7.4%)

$25.3 million
10.3%
Earnings per share
$0.27
$0.24
12.5%
Data source: GameStop's financial filing. YOY = year over year.
GameStop endured a surprisingly large drop in comparable-store sales, down nearly 11%. CEO Paul Raines and his team had projected a more moderate decline of between 4% and 7% this quarter.
Other highlights of the quarter include:
CEO Paul Raines indicated that GameStop's diversification strategy is helping the retailer navigate what he described as a difficult quarter for the video gaming industry. "The continued growth and increased profit contribution of our non-physical gaming businesses drove our second quarter results," Raines said. "Tech brands sales grew more than 50%, omni-channel sales increased 16%, collectibles sales more than doubled and year-to-date, more than half ofGameStop'soperating earnings have come from non-physical gaming categories," he explained.
For the full year, executives see tech brands growing at a 55% clip and collectibles sales rising by 45% on their way to a $1 billion annual business by fiscal 2019. Management has no plans to step away from its core market, either. "Physical video gaming is a strong business, and one with a long tail," executives said in an investor presentation.
Thanks to those growing areas of the business, GameStop affirmed its full-year profit outlook that calls for earnings of about $3.97 per share, up 5% from 2015. The retailer's improving profitability and earnings profile continues to be an important bright spot for shareholders, especially income investors who are attracted by its hefty dividend yield that's well supported by profit and cash flow.
There's no question, though, that its core video game market is weak and declining at a faster pace than management had expected. GameStop lowered its sales growth forecast to as much as a 5% drop in comps -- down from the roughly 2% slide it had projected in late May. Meanwhile, the company remains on pace to shift its business, so that more than half of profits are generated by products other than physical video games by 2019.

WITH A WORKFORCE of 12,000 full-time and 24,000 part-time employees-largely young men in their 20s with far more interest in video games than in benefits selection-GameStop Corp. faced this challenge: how to verify and update employee records for new regulatory requirements and to make benefits enrollment mandatory. In response, the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer created a comprehensive electronic campaign. Working with Univers Workplace Solutions, GameStop created a video of a worker playing a benefits video game. The protagonist in the game deals with unplanned injuries and illness to show employees the importance of being prepared. "Our employees are techies. They are very energetic, passionate and game savvy," says Faye Saenz, director of employee benefits at the Grapevine, Texas-based company. "They weren't going to look at written communication. They like things that are edgy and a little dark. They're connected to several electronic devices at once. We knew we had to change our ways." Full-time employees now receive benefits information through e-mails and automated telephone messages, texts, online videos, Facebook and Twitter pages, Flash presentations and other electronic materials. When full-time employees received a call about benefits, they were automatically connected to the Univers call center to review benefit choices and update their information using an interactive screen. Part-time employees received similar communications, but the information was even more narrowly tailored in a three-week campaign titled Build Your Arsenal. The communication strategy used slightly irreverent information, such as a 60-second Flash movie mixing video game imagery with the real-life peril of getting into an accident and not having health insurance. Employees responded in unprecedented numbers. HR professionals were in touch with almost every eligible full-time employee. Counselors helped them understand their benefits in scheduled 15-minute, in-person visits. Benefits participation rose 38 percent for medical, 162 percent for flexible spending accounts, 100 percent for accident insurance and 211 percent for life insurance. For solving an HR challenge with originality and having a clear understanding of its employees, GameStop wins the Optimas Award for Innovation.

For the quarter ended May 3, the company posted net income of $62.1 million, up from $24.7 million. Revenue climbed 42% to $1.81 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year jumped 27%.

Full text: GameStop Corp.'s fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 46%, thanks to strong videogame sales and a booming market despite the sluggish economy. The Grapevine, Texas, videogame retailer also gave fiscal first-quarter and full-year guidance above Wall Street's expectations. GameStop said same-store sales for the quarter ended Feb. 2 rose 17%, while gross margin slipped to 23.9% from 24.1%. New videogame software sales rose 38% on the back of sales of popular sequels to the Guitar Hero and Call of Duty franchises. New hardware sales jumped 19% despite shortages of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox 360 in January. GameStop expects fiscal first-quarter and full-year per-share earnings of 32 cents to 33 cents and $2.25 to $2.34, respectively. The mean estimate by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial was for earnings of 29 cents and $2.22, respectively. Same-store sales are projected to rise 24% to 25% in the quarter and 10% to 12% for the year. The videogame retail business has been booming, as videogame makers have been churning out new hits as well as sequels to wildly popular games.

Full text: GameStop Corp.'s fiscal second-quarter net income surged on soaring sales of new videogame software and hardware, and the videogame retailer boosted its earnings forecast. Same-store sales grew more than 29%, blowing past the company's previous estimate of 16% to 18% in growth. The main factor in sales for the period was gaming hardware, where sales grew 87%, compared with 49% growth for software sales. The Grapevine, Texas, company is benefiting from the current videogame console upgrade cycle. The past nine months has seen the debut of the PlayStation 3 from Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co.'s Wii. The upgrade cycle also includes the Xbox 360 from Microsoft Corp. In the second quarter, GameStop benefited from the sales of popular franchises such as Guitar Hero from Activision Inc. and NCAA Football from Electronic Arts Inc. GameStop raised its full-year earnings view to $1.45 to $1.48 a share. GameStop in May boosted its full-year earnings forecast to $1.37 to $1.40 a share. GameStop shares were up $4.03, or 9.3%, to $47.45.

Shares of video game publisher Activision Inc. jumped to a 52- week high Wednesday on the heels of a solid fourth-quarter and full- year report from No. 1 game retailer GameStop Inc., whose stock hit a record high for the second day in a row.
Activision, whose games include the "Guitar Hero" and "Tony Hawk" series, is receiving positive early buzz from its third "Spider- Man" title, said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Colin Sebastian in a note to investors.
"Spider-Man 3," the game, is slated to launch in May, simultaneously with the movie.
Activision also continues to reap the benefits of its catalog titles, most notably "Guitar Hero II," which lets players pretend they are rock stars, and the World War II game "Call of Duty." The analyst boosted his fiscal fourth-quarter outlook for Activision, to sales of $225 million from $200 million, and to a net loss of 7 cents per share from a loss of 8 cents. (Video game software publishers make much of their money in the fiscal third quarter due to the holiday shopping season, and often see losses in other quarters.) Shares of the Santa Monica, Calif., company rose 88 cents, or 4.9 percent, to close at $19.01 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Earlier, shares traded as high as $19.20, eclipsing a previous 52-week high of $18.79.
GameStop's shares, meanwhile, rose $1.44, or 4.6 percent, to end at $32.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock hit its prior, split-adjusted all-time high of $31.43 on Tuesday after the company posted its results.
The company's management called the recent European launch of Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3 "very good, but not great," Sebastian wrote, adding that this likely means Sony is "coming close to reaching its one million unit shipment target." The PlayStation 3 was launched in the U.S. in November.
The analyst also noted that March video game retail sales might be slightly hurt by short supplies of the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS.
Sebastian kept a "Buy" rating on Activision with a target price of $20. He rates GameStop "Buy."

Shares of GameStop Corp. edged higher in Wednesday premarket trading, after the video game and software retailer reached an all- time high Tuesday on a positive fiscal fourth-quarter report and 2007 forecast.
The Grapevine, Texas-based company said net income rose 53 percent on a 38 percent jump in revenue to $2.3 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. For the year ending Feb. 2, 2008, GameStop predicts profit of $1.37 to $1.40 per share and expects to open 500 to 550 stores.
Lazard Capital Markets analyst Colin Sebastian said GameStop's revenue was higher than he anticipated due to stronger hardware sales, and same-store sales also beat his expectations. Sebastian raised his price target to $35 from $30 and reiterated a "Buy" rating on the stock.
"While there are still risks associated with the console transitions and sluggish PS3 and Xbox 360 hardware sales, we believe that overall positive industry trends are likely to continue through at least 2008," he said in a note to clients.
Sebastian added the company's successful merger with Electronics Boutique and better sales and earnings justify investor optimism about GameStop.

Video game retailer GameStop beat analysts' fourth-quarter expectations and guided the Street higher for its current quarter and new fiscal year.
Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $129.8 million, or 81 cents a share, from $85 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial were expecting earnings of 80 cents a share.
Sales increased 38.2% to $2.3 billion from $1.67 billion a year ago. That compares with Street expectations of $2.12 billion.
On a comparable-store basis, sales increased 26.5% during the fourth quarter.
Shares of GameStop recently soared $3.03, or 10.8%, to $31 in Tuesday trading.
Brisk sales in January of Vivendi's World of Warcraft game and new video game software titles drove results, said GameStop.
For its current first quarter, the company expects comparable- store sales to range from an increase of 12% to 14%, driven by the expected launches of Sony's PlayStation 3 in Europe and Australia, and continued demand for Microsoft Xbox 360 titles.
Earnings for the first quarter are expected to range from 15 cents a share to 16 cents a share, above analysts' expectations of 13 cents a share.
For fiscal 2007, GameStop said sales are likely to grow between 19% and 21%, with comparable-store sales growth of 14% to 16%, backed by a strong release slate of video game titles across all platforms.
The company forecast earnings for the year to range from $1.37 to $1.40. That compares with analysts' expectations of $1.34 a share.
Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop said it will open 500 to 550 stores worldwide in 2007.

Full text: M2 PRESSWIRE-February 23, 2007-bellwetherreport.com: Morning Alert for GameStop Corp. (C)1994-2007 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD
GameStop holds the top score in the video game retailing industry. The company is the largest retailer of new and used games, hardware, entertainment software, and accessories through nearly 4,500 outlets in the US and 14 other countries. A majority of sales come from new and used video games; stores carry an average of 1,000 new titles and 4,000 used ones. The company also has e-commerce Web sites (GameStop.com, ebgames.com) and publishes Game Informer, a video game magazine that reaches more than 1.5 million subscribers. The company's 2005 purchase of rival Electronics Boutique doubled GameStop's size.
Shares were down 3% in sector snap.

Shares of video game publishers were mixed Wednesday following the release of January sales data from the NPD Group, a market research company, showing solid year-over-year growth in software sales.
Analysts reported that based on NPD figures, video game software sales grew 22 percent year-over-year when adjusted for an extra week in the 2007 retail calendar. Sales of games for next-generation systems -- Sony's PlayStation 3, the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft's Xbox 360 -- drove console software sales, said Prudential analyst John McPeake in a note to investors.
Sales of games for handheld systems grew 17 percent when adjusted for the extra week, and sales from Nintendo DS titles more than doubled, according to McPeake.
Activision Inc. and THQ Inc. are growing at a rate above the rest of the industry, while sector leader Electronic Arts Inc. recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales declines, McPeake noted.
Shares of Activision fell 17 cents to $17.40 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and shares of THQ rose 30 cents to $33.89.
McPeake reiterated an "Overweight" rating on Activision and THQ and kept a "Neutral Weight" rating on EA.
"Activision's 'Guitar Hero II' continues to perform significantly above our expectations selling 270,000 units compared to our estimate of 70,000 units during the month of January," McPeake wrote. "Activision titles also continued to perform well on both the PlayStation 3 and Wii and accounted for 16 percent and 10 percent of software sales, respectively." EA's shares rose 66 cents to $52.46 on the Nasdaq.
The Nintendo Wii led hardware sales during the month, reported Bank of America analyst Michael L. Savner.
Wii sales totaled 436,000 units in January, 46 percent more than the PlayStation 2, which sold 299,000 units, Savner wrote. The Xbox 360 was the third best-selling platform with 294,000 units sold.
Microsoft's shares climbed 36 cents to $29.19 on the Nasdaq. Sony's American depositary shares rose 50 cents to $53.04 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of GameStop Corp., the world's biggest video game retailer, rose $1.75, or 3.3 percent, to $55.66 on the NYSE. In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between $35.87 and $58.42.

On a year-over-year basis, total retail sales jumped a seasonally adjusted 5.4% in December. However, electronics and appliance stores booked a staggering 15% increase -- the biggest year-over-year increase since the early '90s. That's very bullish news.
Along with electronics stores, sales in several other discretionary retail groups showed solid year-over-year improvement for the month. These included general-merchandise retailers, up 5.4%; furniture and home-furnishings stores, up 7.6%; and restaurants, up 9.3%. When discretionary retail spending pops like that, it clearly signals that consumers' income is robust and flowing nicely. That, in turn, means more cash for MP3 players, home- theater systems and digital cameras, and that's undoubtedly bullish for electronics retailers.
In fact, I wasn't surprised that retail sales at electronics stores led the way in December. The group's major discounting fueled a stellar Black Friday shopping weekend, getting the 2006 holiday shopping season off to a vigorous start. My own trips to the mall confirmed that a flood of Nintendo video-game consoles, digital music players and flat-panel, high-definition TVs was pouring out retailers' doors. However, I don't believe anyone expected the group's sales to improve at a mind-boggling 15% clip.
From a bird's-eye view, the electronics retail group also boasts many outstanding fundamentals, including a $36 billion market cap, a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.1, and a return on equity of 15%. Those numbers are attractive, but here's the best part: The group carries a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.26. Translation: For every dollar in owners' equity, electronics stores have just 26 cents in debt. That's less than a fifth of the services industry's long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 1.48, and it shows me that the group maintains solid balance sheets, an important factor for any retailer.
GameStop: This retailer of video-game products and PC entertainment software operates 4,490 stores. It has a $4.4 billion market cap and a weekly chart that looks spectacular.

Leading video-game retailer GameStop on which I've been very bullish in the Breakout Stocks newsletter since mid-July, commented on its third-quarter conference call that the release of "Gears of War" has resulted in a significant increase in Xbox 360 sales. This is a very important data point, as it indicates that gamers have been looking for a reason to buy the Xbox 360, and now they have one. This also benefits software makers like Electronic Arts as the Xbox 360 audience should increase in size nicely over the next few months.

The video game console wars are now in full battle mode thanks to the debut of Nintendo's Wii and the PS3 over the past few days. While the PS3 and the Wii will be available in short supply for the next few months, Sony Nintendo, and Microsoft are nonetheless wholeheartedly scrapping for market share in this latest battle for gaming supremacy. While we continue to like Microsoft for a host of reasons, we recently indicated in an article for subscribers that investors interested in an angle on the console upgrades should consider specialty retailer GameStop . The stock has been volatile since we first broached the subject last month, but thanks to a nice gain today, the stock has advanced about 4% over the last four weeks.

Full text: GameStop Corp. reported a profit for its fiscal third quarter as charges related to the acquisition of Electronics Boutique hurt year- earlier results. For the quarter ended Oct. 28, the Grapevine, Texas, videogame retailer, which was spun off from Barnes & Noble Inc. in 2002, had net income of $13.6 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $2.5 million, or four cents a share. Revenue rose 89% to $1.01 billion, helped by the acquisition of Electronics Boutique late in the year-earlier third quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 8.8%. Videogame sales rose 14%, thanks in part to Madden 2007 NFL, Saints Row and Dead Rising. Hardware sales increased 69%, as Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox 360 was released shortly after last year's third quarter. The release of Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co.'s Wii game systems are seen helping retailers' fourth-quarter results. In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GameStop shares were up $1.84, or 3.6%, to $53.

Sony Corp. has receded from its days of glory, when the Walkman was the synonym for portable music and PlayStation 2 was the pinnacle of video game consoles, having unseated the mighty Nintendo.
While Sony was once an icon of quality, now its batteries are being recalled as fire hazards, mass production problems are delaying wide release of its much-awaited PlayStation 3, and rivals are outselling its TV sets. Amid all this, the company posted a 71 percent decline in the operating profit of its electronic segment in the most recent fiscal quarter, with overall profit down 94 percent, weighed down among other things by the costs of launching the PS3.
Howard Stringer, Sony's first non-Japanese chief executive, is leading the company in a turnaround plan, but the effort has hit some snags, notably the recall of 9.6 million laptop batteries that has cost the company $429 million so far.
The electronics business, Sony's largest segment, is facing growing competition from the likes of Apple Computer's iPod, Samsung's flat-screen television sets and even Nintendo's upcoming Wii console, which will cost half as much as the cheaper version of the PS3.
Citing problems with mass-producing the PS3's Blu-ray video technology, Sony said in September it will delay the European launch of the console and ship a smaller amount to the U.S. and Japan than originally planned.
The company has maintained it still plans to ship 6 million units worldwide by next March. But Piper Jaffray analyst Anthony Gikas is doubtful -- he expects Sony to fall "well short" of this target, shipping only 3.5 million to 4 million of the consoles.
In October, GameStop Corp., the largest U.S. video game retailer, offered its customers a limited number of slots, at $100 each, to pre-order the PlayStation 3. In some cases, the spots were filled within minutes.
If pre-order trends are any indication, the consoles will likely be snagged up in hours, if not minutes, when they reach the stores, and shortages are widely expected, which should bode well for Nintendo and Microsoft.
A week after announcing the PlayStation 3 shortfall, Sony said it was delaying the launch of its digital music player, NW-S203F, due to the malfunction of a component the company did not specify.
And, in October, Sony postponed the release of LocationFree TV Box LF-Box1, which streams TV programs and movies wirelessly to devices such as portable PlayStation units and Macintosh and Windows- based computers.
Some U.S. investors have sold off the company's shares, which are down 10 percent since the beginning of August.
Despite the bad news, Goldman Sachs analyst Yuri Fujimori recommended buying the company's shares, on weakness, to Japanese investors in a recent note to clients.
Merrill Lynch's Hitoshi Kuriyama, who rates Sony "Sell" said the adverse effects of the battery recall, the growing PlayStation 3- related costs and the risk of a PS3 business failure have already factored in to the company's shares, at least to some extent.
Nonetheless, the analysts predicts some risks for 2007, including the profitability of Sony's TV business, as well as responsibility for the battery recalls.
. The call will be archived for two weeks on GameStop Corp.'s website.

The Bellwether Report Takes Notice of GameStop Corp. (Nyse: GME)
GameStop holds the top score in the video game retailing industry. The company is the largest retailer of new and used games, hardware, entertainment software, and accessories through almost 4,500 outlets in the US and 14 other countries. A majority of sales come from new and used video games; stores carry an average of 1,000 new titles and 4,000 used ones. The company also has e-commerce Web sites (GameStop.com, ebgames.com) and publishes Game Informer, a video game magazine that reaches more than 1.5 million subscribers. The company's 2005 purchase of rival Electronics Boutique doubled GameStop's size.
Shares were up 2% after announcing stores are going to start accepting pre-orders for Sony's PlayStation 3.
GameStop and EB Games stores are going to start accepting pre- orders for Sony's PlayStation 3 game console on Tuesday, according to their Web sites.
Due to "extremely limited supply," the stores expect their allocations of what is perhaps the holiday's season's most eagerly anticipated gadget to run out in minutes.
A $100 deposit is required for each order, but even that won't guarantee that a PlayStation 3 will be available when the console goes on sale on Nov. 17, according to the notices, because the stores have no control over production and shipping issues.
The console will be sold in two versions, for $499 and $599. Sony Corp. has said it plans to ship 2 million units by the end of the year.
GameStop and EB Games are both.....

Sales rose to $1.66 billion from $708.7 million, mainly due to the Electronic Boutique stores. Sales at comparable GameStop stores were slightly lower. GameStop plans to open 400 stores this year and 600 stores in 2007 and 2008. It expects first-quarter same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be 7% to 9% lower than a year ago, due mainly to the launch of Sony's PSP hand-held game console in the year-earlier quarter. It expects full-year earnings of $1.83 to $1.93 a share, including 27 cents of stock-based compensation expenses, above forecasts for $1.77 a share by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Shares rose $3.60, or 8.7%, to $45 in New York Stock Exchange 4 p.m. composite trading.

Abstract: GameStop Corp. raised its 2005 earnings guidance after strong December sales. The Grapevine, Texas, videogame retailer now expects to earn $1.75 to $1.78 a share for the full year, above a prior forecast for $1.65 to $1.70 a share. Its shares rose 12%, or $3.86, to $37.31, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Its shares rose 12%, or $3.86, to $37.31, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. A shortage of Microsoft Corp.'s XBox 360 game console during the holiday had been expected to lead to a drop in sales of videogames or hardware. But GameStop said the 1.5% drop in comparable store sales, excluding the October acquisition of the Electronics Boutique videogame store chain, was in line with expectations. Bank of America analyst Gary Cooper, who expected comparable sales to decline 8% to 10% in the quarter, said good sales between Christmas and New Year's helped to temper the decline. GameStop said sales of used games, which carry higher margins than new games, were very brisk and customers who turned in used games put store credit or cash toward buying new games.

Abstract: GameStop Corp. swung to a fiscal third-quarter loss, as same-store sales fell 12%. The Grapevine, Texas, videogame retailer, spun off from Barnes & Noble Inc. last year, posted a loss for the quarter ended Oct. 29 of $2.5 million, or four cents a share, from net income of $12.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.

Full text: GameStop Corp. swung to a fiscal third-quarter loss, as same-store sales fell 12%. The Grapevine, Texas, videogame retailer, spun off from Barnes & Noble Inc. last year, posted a loss for the quarter ended Oct. 29 of $2.5 million, or four cents a share, from net income of $12.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Results include costs of $11.9 million related to its $1.44 billion acquisition of Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp., completed in the quarter. Sales rose 28% to $534.2 million from $416.7 million. GameStop said same- store sales fell because of the lack of major new titles, in contrast to last year's third quarter, when "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" and "Fable" were released. The company also said November new videogame sales were weaker than expected due to many customers waiting for the launch of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox 360 and that this trend will continue "to a degree throughout the holiday season." As of 4 p.m. composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, GameStop class A shares were at $34.99, off 19 cents.

Full text: GameStop Corp.'s profit rose 3% in the fiscal second quarter despite a 20% increase in sales. The Grapevine, Texas, videogame and entertainment-software retailer posted net income of $7.9 million, or 14 cents a share, up from $7.7 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Results for the latest quarter, which ended July 30, included a $1.1 million write-off of used inventory of the game "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas," due to a retroactive ratings change by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. The game was given an "adults-only" rating when it was discovered sexually explicit scenes could be accessed through software available online. The company's sales rose to $415.9 million. GameStop said it expects same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to decrease 8% to 10% in the third quarter because year- earlier sales were driven in part by sales of the "Grand Theft Auto," title. The company expects third-quarter earnings of 18 cents to 20 cents a share.

Full text: GameStop Corp.'s fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 55%, driven by strong performances in both software sales and a resurgent growth in hardware. The Grapevine, Texas, videogame and software retailer reported net income of $10.3 million, or 19 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 30, compared with $6.7 million, or 11 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 28% to $474.7 million from $371.7 million. The company said an "extremely successful" launch of Sony Corp.'s PlayStation Portable game player helped to fuel the strong sales volume during the quarter, as sales at stores open at least a year increased 12%. GameStop's videogame software sales rose 21%. GameStop continues to forecast fiscal year earnings of $1.30 to $1.40 a share, without taking into consideration the planned merger with Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. GameStop shares rose $1.21, or 4.2%, to $29.75 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Full text: GameStop Corp. reported lower net earnings but better sales for the fiscal fourth quarter, and its shares rose. The Grapevine, Texas, videogame store chain said net income in the quarter ended Jan. 29 fell 13% to $34.5 million, or 64 cents a share, from $39.6 million, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue jumped 13% to $708.7 million. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, were essentially flat. The latest period included a charge of $3.3 million, or six cents a share, for an adjustment to lease accounting. GameStop, spun off from Barnes & Noble Inc. last year, said it expects earnings growth on higher revenue in the current fiscal year amid continued demand for Sony Corp.'s slimmer Playstation 2 console and the U.S. introduction of the PlayStation Portable game player. Shares of GameStop were up $2.63, or 13%, at $22.12, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Now you, as an individual investor or investment professional, can have access to the same tools used by equity fund and portfolio managers as they deal with billions of dollars in assets every business day. Our ongoing cooperative research program, involving economists and financial theorists at Yale University and our own development team, has forged a solid bridge between the academic world and the marketplace. Thus armed with the freshest concepts and ideas, the ValuEngine team tests new theories and works out practical applications for them. We can say without fear of contradiction that there is no asset valuation and forecasting system in use today that is the equal of ValuEngine.

Independent, numbers-based, objective Equity Research
Use this report to help to :
- Optimize your equity portfolio for the best risk/return ratio.
- Forecast equity portfolio's value next year.
- Find a fair value for stocks and forecast their future prospects.
- Determine the chances of gain or loss on current holdings.
- Find momentum & volatility ranks for stocks.
"Yale finance professor Dr. Zhiwu Chen has done an excellent job of transforming academic research and rigorous mathematics into a practical investing tool. The valuation model combines 12-month trailing EPS, consensus analyst estimates, and the 30-year Treasury yield to come up with a fair value price for any stock. Then its forecast model uses common market trends such as momentum and price reversals, and runs simulations to determine the most probable price outcomes over three years." - Forbes
Note on the Models used to create the reports:
These company reports employ many proprietary models, which were adapted from innovative concepts in finance theory generated both in academia and from Wall Street practice. Each of the four ValuEngine models represents the state-of-the-art in valuation, forecasting technologies:
1) The VE Stock Valuation Model 2) The VE Stock Forecast Model 3) The VE Portfolio Advisor Model 4) The VE Portfolio Forecast Model
The ValuEngine Stock Valuation Model
The ValuEngine Stock Valuation Model was derived from the recent research and findings of Dr. Zhiwu Chen, Professor of Finance, Yale University, and his co-authors. The model is more sophisticated than traditional valuation models and outperforms its peers by employing a three-factor approach to stock valuation. Fundamental variables such as a company's trailing 12-month Earnings-Per-Share (EPS), the analyst consensus estimate of the company's future 12-month EPS, and the 30-year Treasury yield are all combined and used to create a more accurate reflection of a company's fair value. Armed with these framework features, the Model then paints a detailed picture of a company's fair value, which is represented by the "model price."
The ValuEngine Stock Forecast Model
The predictive variables used in the forecasting models include both proprietary and well-established forecasting variables derived from credible financial research studies and publications. They use a distinct forecasting model for each forecasting horizon and every industry. The forecasting models capture, among other things, several important tendencies that stock prices consistently exhibit: Short-term price reversals Intermediate-term momentum continuation Long-term price reversals. They then apply the most advanced statistical/econometric techniques to ensure that the stock return forecasts are as reliable as possible. In addition, they have a realistic econometric model for assessing a stock's and a portfolio's future return prospects. This econometric model involves running thousands of simulations to estimate the probability of a double in stock price as well as the probability of meeting and exceeding any given investment target by a stock or a portfolio of stocks.
The ValuEngine Portfolio Forecast Model
The PortfolioForecast tool arrives at projections by utilizing forecasting models to estimate future returns for the individual stocks in a portfolio. After computing the future return forecasts for each stock, they then run thousands of concurrent simulations for all of the stocks in a given portfolio (subject to various econometric requirements). The thousands of simulated price paths created by this process form the basis for the PortfolioForecast projections. Finally, the PortfolioForecast tool calculates the most likely return forecast from the thousands of simulated outcomes.
The ValuEngine Portfolio Advisor Model
The ValuEngine PortfolioAdvisor enables you to specify the following portfolio objectives: Maximize the chance of meeting or exceeding an investment target; Minimize the chance of loss; Both of the above.
Choosing the first option will prompt PortfolioAdvisor to create an aggressive yet risky portfolio. Choosing the second option will prompt PortfolioAdvisor to search for a conservative mix of stocks that will seek to preserve capital. Choosing the third option will prompt PortfolioAdvisor to create a balanced portfolio that will seek to both maximize potential gains and minimize potential losses. Once you have specified an investment objective, PortfolioAdvisor will utilize our forecasting models to estimate future returns for the individual stocks in your portfolio. PortfolioAdvisor will then examine tens of thousands of possible capital allocation plans distributed across the stocks of your choice. From the results of these simulations, PortfolioAdvisor will identify and display the most favorable stock allocation for your portfolio. Additionally, PortfolioAdvisor will inform you of the exact number of shares to buy or sell of each stock so that the resulting portfolio will maximize your chances of maximizing gain, minimizing loss, or both.
Back Testing
Every valuation, forecasting, and advisory model has been extensively back-tested in the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan equities markets.
The investment performance of each model has been proven to exceed that of many well-known stock-picking styles.
