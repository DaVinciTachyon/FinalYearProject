June 10 2020: GameStop Reports First Quarter Results
GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today reported sales and earnings for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020.
George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, "During this unprecedented time, our priority is focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and business partners as we continue the process of opening our stores as restrictions are lifted, in our ongoing effort to meet our customers' needs. We are proud of our team's ability to quickly adapt to meet the increased demand for our product offerings. As the pandemic spread, we leaned in on our upgraded omni-channel capabilities to fulfill customer orders through curbside pick-up where available, we reduced discretionary spending and enhanced our liquidity while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. While we delivered a loss for the quarter in total, our performance included total sales just shy of our original expectations, even as stores closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and key video game titles shifted to the second and third quarters, exacerbating the headwind from operating in the final stage of a console cycle. Even more impressive is that our e-commerce sales grew 519% in the first quarter and over 1,000% during the six weeks that our store base temporarily closed to customer access. We believe this reflects the loyalty of the GameStop customer and the confidence they place in us as their preferred place to shop."

Full text: The House Financial Services Committee is calling several witnesses in a hearing Thursday , including individual investor Keith Gill, to find out what happened during the retail-investor-led run-up of GameStop Corp.
The committee said the run-up raises questions about brokerage buying restrictions, payment for order flow , existing rules for shorting stocks , and anti-market-manipulation laws in the social-media era.
Here's what you need to know about the witnesses:
Keith Gill PHOTO: Kayana Szymczak for The Wall Street Journal
Keith Gill, 34, lives outside Boston and acquired big positions in GameStop stock and options. As the pseudonymous "DeepF—ingValue" on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, he inspired many GameStop traders .
Gabe Plotkin, 42, is the founder of hedge fund Melvin Capital Management LP and protégé of trader Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management LP. Melvin was one of the hottest hedge funds around—until it lost billions in January from bets against GameStop and other stocks. Point72, hedge fund Citadel LLC and Citadel partners invested $2.75 billion in Melvin in January as its losses mounted.
Vlad Tenev is chief executive of online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc. With a game-like interface and free trades, Robinhood became the preferred app of the retail-investor crowd . Its users traded so much GameStop that Robinhood faced overwhelming capital calls from its clearinghouse and had to stop users from buying it.
Steve Huffman is the CEO of the social-media platform Reddit, host to the WallStreetBets forum popular with amateur traders that sparked the GameStop trading frenzy . The brash community cheers each other on to buy certain stocks.
Ken Griffin is the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Citadel LLC. Citadel Securities, an affiliate of the fund, is an electronic trading firm that executes orders placed by traders of online brokerages such as Robinhood and TD Ameritrade.
Here are people to know on the House Financial Services Committee:
Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) is the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. Ms. Waters said late last month that she called the hearing to look at the frenzy . In a statement, she said, "We must examine the market in general and how it has been manipulated by hedge funds and their financial partners to benefit themselves while others pay the price."
Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) is the top Republican on the committee. Mr. McHenry called the trading frenzy a " power to the people moment " on Cheddar, but said he didn't want to focus on any one company and would instead look for legal issues.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) is one of the most high-profile Democrats in Congress. She was critical of Robinhood's initial pause on buying, calling it unacceptable, and late last month accused the company on Twitter of unfairly targeting amateur investors .
Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.), another progressive, also focused her ire on Robinhood, accusing the company on Twitter of " stealing millions of dollars from their users to protect people who've used the stock market as a casino for decades."
Rep. Ritchie Torres (D., N.Y.), a freshman congressman who has aligned himself with the party's left flank, late last month accused Robinhood of "essentially rigging the game against its own customers," on Good Morning America, and said the GameStop frenzy happened because there are not clear enough rules against market manipulation.

Wall Street's main regulator is weighing whether to require more transparency of short selling and the opaque network of stock lending and borrowing that facilitates it, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Securities and Exchange Commission was ordered 11 years ago to impose such rules but never did it. Now, dealing with the fallout from frenetic trading in GameStop Corp. shares, the agency under new leadership is considering using its authority to shine more light on the mechanics of the bearish trades.
The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law required the SEC to collect information about how much of each public company's stock has been sold short. The SEC doesn't gather or disseminate data on such bets by specific investors.
House lawmakers meeting Thursday plan to examine the GameStop trading and discuss the dearth of short-sale data, according to a memorandum issued in advance of the hearing. The memo noted that the SEC hadn't completed its responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank mandate.
It isn't clear what specific disclosures the SEC would propose. Any new requirements would have to be issued first for public comment before commissioners could vote to adopt them.
GameStop's sudden surge last month, from around $20 to over $400, forced hedge funds that had bet against the stock to either put up more margin or buy the stock to close out their positions, which sent the stock soaring higher. Regulators now must piece together data from brokerages to understand which asset managers were most vulnerable to the GameStop short squeeze, which accelerated as many smaller traders gathering on Reddit urged one another to buy the shares.
The SEC has in the past declined to require greater disclosure of short selling, including how much of a stock has been lent out. One provision of Dodd-Frank required the SEC to issue rules within two years that would enhance public information about the lending or borrowing of securities. Another told the agency to publicly report, at least once a month, on how much of a company's shares have been shorted.
Some SEC officials have in the past expressed concern that if big investors had to disclose short positions, others might be prompted to copy and crowd into such trades, raising the costs for short sellers to borrow stock, one of the people said. The SEC is now under Democratic control and steered by Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee.
"They have the rule-making authority to do almost anything, but generally they have not done much," said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.
Short sales are typically arranged by brokerages, which allow clients to sell stock they don't own as long as those shares can be borrowed, often from mutual funds. It is possible for the same shares to be lent out multiple times, which can cause short interest in a stock to approach substantial levels. Short sellers exit the trade and make money if share prices fall below where they were when the stock was borrowed.
Some investors say too much transparency could put a damper on the activity, which can serve a beneficial role by keeping share prices closer to fair value and allowing investors to hedge their risk.
The stock-loan market is a back-office operation typically controlled by brokerages. The SEC could require a new type of "ticker tape" that would publicly report when shares are borrowed for short sales and how much it costs to finance the position, Mr. Angel said.
Some SEC officials have acknowledged in conversations with Wall Street executives that it could have been useful during the most recent tempest to have a repository of data to draw on for a fuller picture.
The SEC is now analyzing what happened with GameStop and plans to publicly report on the factors that drove the price to rise and then collapse. The agency's staff will analyze the role of short sellers in the tumult and could recommend policy changes, the people said. SEC officials have discussed the Dodd-Frank mandates that were never completed in conversations with some market participants, the people said.
Nasdaq Inc. has endorsed requiring institutional investors to report their bearish bets on periodic forms they file with the SEC. Nasdaq argues the disclosure would help public companies engage with investors who may be working behind the scenes to drive down share prices.
It isn't clear if having the information would have prevented such a squeeze. But implementing the rules would have given the SEC more visibility into the exact sizes of positions by big investors. It would have allowed them to know, for instance, if just a few hedge funds accounted for the short interest in GameStop, creating a higher likelihood that the stock would skyrocket if they had to buy back the stock and unwind their positions.
Asset managers, hedge funds and other big institutions regularly disclose stock positions each quarter to the SEC. Those reports don't have to disclose short positions.

Full text: Fidelity Investments sold nearly all of its positions in GameStop Corp. last month, just as shares of the videogame retailer were surging.
Fidelity's GameStop stake dropped to 87 shares on Jan. 29 from 9.3 million shares, or 13% of the company, on Dec. 31, according to securities filings . The sales ended Fidelity's run as the volatile stock's largest shareholder.
It has been an eventful year for GameStop and its investors.
Shares of the company rocketed above $300 a share from less than $20 in January as individual investors turned to message boards on Reddit and urged one another to bid up the stock. The rally pressured other investors who were betting on a selloff. In the ensuing short squeeze, bearish investors had to buy more stock to close out their positions. Their purchases only drove the stock price higher.
Some bearish hedge funds, including Melvin Capital Management, took heavy losses—a development hailed by some individual investors as a triumph over Wall Street.
In reality, though, a number of hedge funds and large financial institutions also profited off GameStop's rise. Senvest Management LLC, a New York hedge fund, racked up profits of nearly $700 million on GameStop.
Nearly all of Fidelity's year-end holdings were housed in two mutual funds run by Joel Tillinghast, one of the firm's brightest star stock pickers and its dean of value investing.
Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund, which Mr. Tillinghast has managed since 1989, has climbed 7% so far this year. Mr. Tillinghast's Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund is up 8.9%.
Mr. Tillinghast shared his thesis for owning smaller retail companies in a July 31 commentary to investors, noting, "If there is a vaccine for Covid-19, and smaller-cap companies, such as retailers and apparel companies, transition successfully to an optimal business model of both e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar stores, it's possible that many undervalued smaller-cap companies demonstrate exceptional earnings growth."
He has stayed true to his strategy, even as value shares underperformed technology companies and other growth stocks.
"You can never predict when the excitement or exuberance for a specific type of stock will end," he wrote in July. "But I can tell you that the market's style leadership—value versus growth—has historically rotated over multiyear periods."
The positions listed in Fidelity's filings don't include those held in funds subadvised by Geode Capital, a sister company that manages all of Fidelity's stocks-index investments.

Full text: The recent trading in GameStop stock is a remarkable example of the power of the internet and electronic trading to democratize capital markets—one that offers both hope for small investors and a note of caution for larger institutional players ("GameStop-Hit Fund Lost 53% in January," Page One, Feb 1).
Wall Street and the capital markets have long been dominated by those who have the power to get in early and move markets, while small investors have been mostly left out. Regulations have supported this structure on the theory that small investors need to be protected from risk.
The challenge is that to protect one from risk also prevents one from gains. There are no such things as slam-dunk investments, and all bets can go down. To limit investors' exposure to risk is to impede their ability to create wealth—something that should be easier than ever before given the market knowledge and access provided by modern technology.
Small investors made their voices heard, using the internet to force hedge funds into a short squeeze. Score one for the little guys. Is it a turning of the tides or a blip in the radar of the capital markets? That will depend on these increasingly empowered investors and how they continue to advocate for their interests in the public markets, message forums and everywhere in between.

Regarding your editorial " The Reddit Wolves of Wall Street " (Jan. 29) and David Battan's " Why Brokers Had to Restrain Trading in GameStop Shares " (op-ed, Feb. 2): If the brokers had acted as a result of financial and regulatory concerns, they would have raised margin requirements or suspended the purchase of GameStop (GME) on margin. That is not what they did. Rather, the brokerages in question barred individual investors from buying GME even when they were not purchasing the stock on margin. There is no scenario where a broker could be on the hook for an investor purchasing GME in an all cash/nonmargin account.
As a result of creating a one-way street on GME (you could sell but not buy) the stock dropped more than $200 per share. Hedge funds that were short GME reduced the short interest by more than 20% during this 48-hour period when individual investors were barred from buying the stock at many brokerages. Can the Journal point to any other historical instances where brokers have permitted the sale of a stock while barring the purchase of a stock? Can any economist look us in the eye and argue that permitting the sale but not the purchase of a stock could lead to anything but a price collapse?

Robinhood didn't just suspend option trading, it suspended stock trading. It refused to execute my purchase transactions funded by my account's cash balance of stocks on its restricted list. Who is Robinhood to dictate how much of a particular stock I should own?
Jacques Knez
Scottsdale, Ariz.
While I hold no shares of GameStop, any person buying them will tell you they know they're on the hook for whatever money they lose. But if big firms go bankrupt from their bad decisions, somebody will bail them out. Whether individuals were investing as part of a class war, in search of riches or just for amusement, it's certain this episode will greatly erode whatever faith the younger generations have in the integrity of our market system. The damage from that will be far greater than any monetary losses involved.

Full text: The GameStop saga rattled a lot of people.
Hedge funds who shorted the stock were crushed as it soared 10-fold in five days. New buyers who were sucked in late by the prospect of quick profits then lost horribly, with the stock down almost 90% from its high after falling 42% on Thursday. Even those who got in early can't be happy to see so much of their newfound wealth evaporate. Trust in Wall Street, in the clearing system and in popular broker Robinhood have all been damaged, and opportunistic politicians from left and right have leapt on the moves to support their existing policy positions.
Yet, investors might reasonably be reassured by the resilience of the wider market. If that sounds odd, bear with me. Last week the broad selloff by hedge funds as they cut their leverage shook up stocks, with those heavily shorted rallying hard while the rest fell. Volatility jumped. The S&P 500 had its two worst days since October, as the effect of deleveraging was worsened by worries about the knock-on effects if a big hedge fund collapsed.
The market became highly sensitive to GameStop. Since the retailer was listed by then-owner Barnes & Noble in 2002, it has tended to move in the same direction as the S&P, with the 100-day correlation in their moves always being positive. Over the 10 days to Tuesday, the stock has moved in the same direction only twice, and the 100-day correlation is now negative. What was good for GameStop was bad for the market, and vice versa.
The reason for comfort is that stocks didn't suffer more. It isn't so much that we should be relieved that GameStop and the broader coordinated attacks by users of Reddit didn't bring down a broker or start a chain reaction of hedge-fund failures, although of course that would have been very bad. The good news is that these worries didn't trigger a significant correction.
Put simply: The GameStop shenanigans didn't prick the market bubble, and maybe that means there isn't a bubble.
My view continues to be that parts of the market are wildly overdone and in mini-bubbles, notably anything connected to electric cars or new energy. Both are clearly growth industries. But the market is throwing money at these companies as though they alone will make technological breakthroughs and have no competition nor setbacks . These assumptions are likely to prove wrong.
The case for the wider market being in a bubble is less clear. True, valuations are back at dot-com-era levels, IPOs—and their close relative, SPACs—are on a tear and sentiment gauges show little fear. Pretty much every measure screams excess .
But this is explained neatly by the old argument of TINA: There Is No Alternative to stocks at a time when the 10-year Treasury yields only just over 1%. Relative to bonds, stocks still look fine.
There is an important nuance to the claim that it is all about TINA. Stocks are affected by both low Treasury yields and the weak economy. The biggest winners from low yields are those with profits far in the future, notably growth stocks such as Alphabet or Microsoft that also have solid earnings, and story stocks like Tesla with negligible net income but the hope of big earnings one day. These stocks gain from low yields, but because their growth is only loosely tied to the economy, its weakness doesn't hold them back.
Contrast that with cyclical stocks where earnings are closely tied to the economic outlook, and there's little else to provide long-term growth. These stocks—car-parts suppliers or bricks-and-mortar retailers, for example—get far less benefit from lower bond yields and suffer more from the pain in the economy, and have lagged far behind.
The U.S. market is dominated by the TINA winners, so low yields have helped the market overall. In Europe, the big stocks tend to rely more on economic growth, so even the region's negative yields have only just been enough to offset the hit to the market from the economy's troubles.
Bubble believers can always argue that the GameStop shenanigans just weren't enough to break through the market's complacency. Reddit traders might repeat with a new target, or yet-to-be-revealed losses might still take down a financial player. And of course Treasury yields rising faster than expected would still be bad, perhaps awful, for the market even in the no-bubble scenario.
But investors should take at least a crumb of comfort that the market has so far avoided a major tumble thanks to GameStop.

Full text: Richard Mashaal and Brian Gonick started buying GameStop Corp. shares in September.
They aren't Reddit day traders or Discord users. They are hedge-fund managers in New York. And when the stock surged from less than $10 a share to above $400 and the dust had settled, they were sitting on a profit of nearly $700 million, one of the great fortunes of the January market mania.
The GameStop surge is often cast as a triumph of amateurs over professionals. Which it was, to a degree. But it also was a trade that pitted professionals against other professionals—and few have made more money than Senvest Management LLC, Messrs. Mashaal's and Gonick's firm.
"When it started its march, we thought, something's percolating here," said Mr. Mashaal, 55 years old. "But we had no idea how crazy this thing was going to get."
Senvest's interest in the videogame retailer was piqued by a presentation from the new GameStop chief executive at a consumer investment conference in January 2020.
At the time, most Wall Street analysts had rated the videogame retailer at "hold" or "sell." The stock also was heavily shorted. Messrs. Mashaal and Gonick would come to know some of the top-returning hedge funds on Wall Street, including Melvin Capital Management , were bearish on the stock from regulatory disclosures.
But as they spoke with management, sussed out competitors and noted the involvement of activists in the stock, including Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, they eventually started buying. By the end of October, Senvest owned more than 5% of the company, paying under $10 a share for the bulk of the stock.
They thought that if GameStop could hold on until the next generation of videogame consoles came out and stoked demand for games and accessories, the company would get a boost. And they reasoned that if Mr. Cohen could help transform GameStop from a largely bricks-and-mortar operation into an online gaming destination, the company could be worth far more.
Messrs. Mashaal and Gonick had been on the wrong end of short squeezes before at Senvest. One case was with opioid maker Insys Therapeutics Inc., though they ultimately made money on their short position. GameStop's stock could soar if it got caught up in a situation in which its rising price forced bearish investors to start buying back shares to curb their losses, they thought.
GameStop is now Senvest's most profitable investment by dollars earned and by its internal rate of return—a performance metric that takes into account the length of an investment. It has propelled the firm's flagship stock-picking fund from running $1.6 billion at the end of 2020 to $2.4 billion. For the month of January, the fund returned 38.4% after fees.
The dominant narrative coming out of January so far has been the flipping on its head of the natural pecking order on Wall Street, with hedge funds dealing with sizable losses and individual investors flush with victory after banding together to drive up the price on a handful of stocks once left for dead. But even before this week's weakening in the rally, the reality was more nuanced.
Mudrick Capital Management LP, a $3 billion-plus New York hedge fund that provided a lifeline to AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. in December, made almost $200 million largely on AMC in January. The movie-theater chain, which had been fighting off bankruptcy, had been one of the retail crowd's darlings recently.
Mudrick's gains come mostly from its holdings in AMC debt, which rallied last week as AMC's share price soared. The fund also made about $50 million writing and selling call options on AMC and GameStop shares it owned.
PlusTick Management in Charlottesville, Va., which runs a stock- and bond-picking hedge fund that manages about $120 million, gained 20% in January, said an investor. Part of its gains came from existing stakes in companies including BlackBerry Ltd. and beleaguered shopping-center owner Macerich Co. Both companies have been touted on message boards recently.
"You always pinch yourself until the last day of the month as to whether it's going to hold," said partner Adrian Keevil.
Other funds jumped into trading in the weekly call options for GameStop and profited in some cases, traders said. Given the volume of stock and options traded in GameStop and other names, they say, individual investors drove only part of the activity.
"It is not just little people on the long side here. There are huge players playing both sides of GameStop," said Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc.
Senvest Management was founded in 1997 by Mr. Mashaal with an investment from Montreal-based Senvest Capital, his father's investment firm. Mr. Gonick, his former college roommate, joined as co-chief investment officer in 2008.
Senvest invests in 25 to 30 companies at a time. The pair describe the fund as a contrarian investor focused on value investing, or the discipline of buying cheap stocks they think will eventually deliver superior returns. They say they actively discourage their team from attending idea dinners and socializing with others in the industry, which they say leads to groupthink and crowded positions.
The main hedge fund has averaged about 18.3% a year for investors through January, according to a person familiar with the fund. It also is highly volatile. It lost 24.1% in 2018, but made 18% the following year, according to an investor document.
Senvest's approach doesn't mean they are above speaking with others about investment ideas when it works to their advantage.
Brian McGough and Jeremy McLean are analysts at Hedgeye Risk Management, a Stamford, Conn., company that sells independent research to institutional and individual investors.
On Dec. 17, when GameStop stock closed at $14.83, the pair announced they were adding GameStop to their long list of "Best Ideas." The next week, they held an hour-long presentation explaining why they thought the stock could be worth $100.
Unbeknown to Hedgeye's clients, Senvest had recently pitched GameStop to Hedgeye, laying out its thesis for the stock.
A person familiar with Senvest said Hedgeye made an independent call to recommend GameStop. Still, in doing so, Senvest likely played a role in pushing some individual investors into GameStop.
"I respect Senvest a lot," said Mr. McGough. "We vetted it independently and we came up with a similar conclusion." He said it is "not terribly common" to be pitched ideas.
Once the rally in GameStop started, a steady drumbeat of developments made Messrs. Mashaal and Gonick start to think about bailing out of the stock. The two men were glued to their screens tracking the action. They surfed or snowshoed to let off steam.
When Citadel LLC, Citadel Partners and Point72 Asset Management last Monday invested $2.75 billion into Melvin Capital, which was taking steep losses, Messrs. Mashaal and Gonick suspected Melvin had gotten out of its GameStop position and wondered about how much momentum from shorts covering could be left.
After the market's close on Jan. 26, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted "GameStonk!!" a rallying cry to users of Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, who had put their support behind GameStop.
Senvest, which had slowly been trimming its position, decided to get out completely.
"Given what was going on, it was hard to imagine it getting crazier," Mr. Mashaal said.
On Wednesday afternoon, the firm shared the news of its robust GameStop profit with their clients.
Despite the rally's fade this week, Senvest said the GameStop story will change one part of how they do business: The firm will pay close attention to whether individual investors are discussing a stock on message boards before they bet on or against it.
"I wouldn't expect that impact to be over," Mr. Gonick said.

Full text: There is a widely held view that the GameStop megarally has been bad news for Wall Street. But that depends on one's definition of Wall Street.
Certainly last week was challenging for many in places like Greenwich, Conn., or Midtown Manhattan, where many hedge funds are set up. Funds betting against shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted companies have logged big losses. But many others employed in finance and trading may not have had such a bad week.
For example, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note last week that a daily index they track measuring performance of hedge funds that go long and short equities experienced a decline of about 2% over Tuesday and Wednesday, which the analysts noted wasn't unusually large and suggested that "any heavy losses in this space would most likely be confined to a few hedge funds."
Individual investors also aren't alone in the ability to trade beyond fundamentals: Many quantitative funds trade on data signals and price movements. Justin Zhen, co-founder of Thinknum Alternative Data, said he started getting calls from quant firms last week seeking to generate sentiment measures from Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, where much of the discussion among individual investors surrounding shares like GameStop has originated. His data firm began monitoring the forum and providing hourly updates. "I've never seen so much inbound for one data set in my life," he said.
What kind of week will it prove to have been in Chicago's Loop, New Jersey or lower Manhattan, where electronic market-making trading firms have traditionally clustered? The wider spreads, higher volatility and big volume sparked by the Reddit-fueled trades are typically ripe conditions for market makers, which aim to facilitate trading by rapidly buying and selling. At some point trading can become too wild, and technology has strained to keep up with the volume. The attention on Robinhood Markets' relationships with wholesale market makers that pay for its order flow, such as Citadel Securities , also has been intense. But by at least one measure, it wasn't a bad week for market makers: Shares of publicly listed electronic market maker Virtu Financial rose 12%, its best weekly gain since last March.
As for the geographic vicinity of Wall Street itself, there is the New York Stock Exchange, owned by Intercontinental Exchange. U.S. equity markets have logged huge volume, with a record 24.5 billion shares trading hands on Wednesday, according to figures tracked by Piper Sandler analysts. That is roughly 10 billion more than the daily average in 2021.
If Wall Street means investment banks, they, too, can do well when volumes and volatility are high. A rush of new stock or convertible issuance also would further boost banks' capital markets units. But sometimes the kind of volatility that sees a lot of clients—like short-selling funds—closing up shop or pulling in bets can depress trading revenue . By some measures, hedge funds have broadly cut their overall borrowing to trade, which could hurt some brokers. However, stock loans across the market appear to remain in demand: The percentage of available share value that was on loan in the Americas was higher week over week on Thursday, according to DataLend.
Investors in financial companies erred on the side of caution, perhaps because of the intense anger and political attention now focused on the sector, which might herald regulatory or behavioral changes. Shares of investment banks, exchanges and online brokers widely tumbled last week.
Clearly something big and uncertain is happening, and investors are right to be wary. But it would be premature to conclude that "Wall Street" writ large has been beaten at its own game.

Full text: When some online brokers including Robinhood Markets Inc. and Webull Financial LLC moved this week to restrict trading in GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other stocks, fueled by Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, they did so in part because of obligations with clearinghouses that help ensure trading across the market isn't disrupted by defaults. Here's how it works.
What is a clearinghouse?
Consider the basics of trading: Buyers and sellers must agree on a price. The buyer then must pay the seller, and ownership must be formally transferred.
Enter clearinghouses. The clearinghouse collects and distributes payments and transfers ownership. So traders are free to focus just on price, and to take the best price in the market regardless of who is offering it. Neither side has to worry about the other's ability to pay.
For stocks in the U.S., the main clearinghouse is National Securities Clearing Corp., which is part of a larger clearing organization that operates in other markets, called Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.
How do they work?
Clearinghouses serve to mutualize risk. Members keep cash or collateral such as Treasury securities at the clearinghouse to cover their own activities and the obligations of other members should they fail. The clearinghouse might ask the members to post more of this money, often known as margin, if they are making riskier trades. The aim is to ensure that no individual member's failure causes the whole system to collapse.
How does the financial crisis figure in this?
In response to the 2008 collapse of broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., lawmakers writing the Dodd-Frank Act sought to beef up supervision of clearinghouses and to push more trading into clearinghouses. The focus was primarily on so-called over-the-counter derivatives, like credit-default swaps, that didn't have a central marketplace. The reforms also affected some longstanding clearinghouses, including National Securities Clearing Corp., by designating them as systemically important financial market utilities, which subjected them to greater regulatory scrutiny.
Why would a clearinghouse have to increase requirements?
As noted earlier, margin requirements often rise with risk. A sharp rise in the price of any security raises the prospect that it will decline just as fast, potentially adding to the risk of those trading and holding as collateral these securities.
A challenge in the stock market is that settlement is not instant. The system allows two days after the day a trade happens until the shares and money must change hands, known as "T+2" settlement. Over those two days, the risk that a party might be unable to complete a trade can, in rare circumstances, change dramatically based on market conditions.
One such circumstance might be when the price of a security is extraordinarily volatile. In that case, the seller is exposed to increased risk that in the event of a failure of a buyer to pay up, the security they would be stuck still owning is worth dramatically less. The extraordinary volatility of a stock like GameStop would increase such a concern.
Another is the risk that a party suddenly owes an outsize amount of cash. In a normal market, any clearing member likely has a mostly balanced book of buys and sells, meaning they are both paying and receiving cash. And often many of their own customers' trades cancel each other, meaning they have no net obligation to the clearinghouse. But when a firm has a huge imbalance of buy orders, its obligation to pay cash skyrockets. This may have been the case this week, when there was much demand for just one or two stocks.
So who decides it's time to increase margin requirements?
How a clearinghouse judges these risks, and therefore when it makes demands for more upfront funds, is typically formulaic. Margins can be based on equations such as value-at-risk. Exactly how the formula works, and who is responsible for losses in what order, are important elements. In the case of National Securities Clearing Corp., losses would be covered by the defaulting member's funds before the clearinghouse's own funds or other members' funds would be used.
A broker like Robinhood would also have to make decisions about its own capital, and how much it was willing or able to tie up in settlement. A broker may face separate obligations for capital levels, like with the SEC. Other brokers also clear via another intermediary—like Apex Clearing, through which WeBull clears—that is a member. These intermediaries may have their own risk controls they apply to their clients.

Full text: A short seller is calling it quits.
Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research, on Friday said his firm will no longer be publishing short-seller reports, on the heels of backlash to his recent public skepticism about shares of GameStop Corp. Instead, the firm will pivot to providing insight into companies the firm thinks investors should buy, Mr. Left said.
For more than a decade, Mr. Left had been well known for attempting to expose fraud at larger companies, publishing lengthy reports and making significant bets that these firms' shares would decline in value. Among his more well-known calls was a successful bet against Valeant Pharmaceuticals.
But this week, Mr. Left has been the target of ire from stock traders who have come together online to drive up shares of an unlikely momentum stock , mall retailer GameStop. Mr. Left, 50 years old, had been publishing negative reports about the firm in recent weeks.
Some of these traders have shared his personal information, hacked into Mr. Left's social-media accounts and texted Mr. Left and his two children, using threatening, profane and personal language, according to people close to the matter.
"The risk-reward of being a short seller is not worth it; it's not worth it for me or my family," Mr. Left said in an interview.
The decision, he says, is a reflection of the new market.
"Young people want to buy stocks. That's the zeitgeist. They don't want to short stocks, so I'm going to help them buy stocks," he said.
Mr. Left said he is still critical of GameStop's stock and others that are popular lately, but he says he felt a need to change his business to appeal to the new traders.
"I'll take the skepticism and mentality of short selling and apply it to the long side," he said.
Mr. Left announced the decision in a YouTube video early Friday. He called the move a simple pivot.
"When we started Citron, it was to be against the establishment. We've actually become the establishment," said Mr. Left in the video.
Still, he is proud of the work Citron did.
"We uncovered more fraud than any nongovernmental agency out there," he says.

Full text: The power dynamics are shifting on Wall Street. Stocks of struggling companies, such as including GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and BlackBerry Ltd., rallied due to the efforts of individual investors. These newbies are gathering on Reddit, Discord and Twitter, where they encourage each other to pile into stocks, and, at times, have banded together to intensify losses among professional traders. Here's how these investors are making their mark.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. Signs of individual investor interest in GameStop began to emerge in earnest in 2019 on Reddit forums.
In 2019, some Reddit users posted screenshots of bullish options positions and debated whether the GameStop stock could rise. One Reddit user posted in March 2019 that the struggling videogame retailer was a "deep value play." By 2020, momentum about a possible short squeeze grew and many users predicted that new gaming consoles, including the PlayStation 5, could help lift the share price of the company. By early January, GameStop had moved from a stock recommendation to a phenomenon. The stock wasn't just an opportunity for a big payday or a way to back a struggling company. Buying GameStop for some users had turned into a way to confront institutional money. Users encouraged others to hold the line: "Do not sell."
2. Activity among individual investors has surged during the pandemic.
In 2020 alone, it is estimated that more than 10 million new trading accounts were created, according to JMP Securities. The increase in accounts comes as options bets have become more accessible. Options give investors the right to buy or sell shares at specific prices, later in time. They can be used as trading tools to wager on the direction of stocks, or to hedge portfolios. Recently, many investors have been using them to rapidly double, triple or even quadruple their money, since they can put down a relatively small sum in exchange for a giant return, though they risk a giant loss.
3. The surging share price for GameStop stock created a snowball effect.
Investors have been snapping up options on GameStop that would expire within days. More than 2 million options contracts tied to GameStop changed hands Friday, the most on record. As shares rise, dealers who have sold the calls—which give buyers the right to buy the underlying stock at a particular price within a specified time period—have to buy shares to hedge their positions. These call options multiplied in value as GameStop shares surged, forcing dealers to buy even more of the company's shares to hedge their positions. The surging share price lured even more traders into the fray, spurring demand for the shares, creating a snowball effect. Meanwhile, systematic funds started to get involved in the stocks, helping push the stocks higher. On Thursday GameStop and AMC shares tumbled, with a number of possible forces likely contributing to the drop, including trading limits on popular apps like Robinhood and profit taking from investors sitting on massive gains.
4. Some of Wall Street's best traders have faced big losses.
Top-performing hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which managed $12.5 billion at the start of the year, had lost nearly 30% for the year through Friday due largely to its array of bets against companies including GameStop, said people familiar with the fund. Melvin's put options against GameStop, which are bearish contracts that typically profit as stocks fall, expired in mid-January. With losses mounting, Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin orchestrated an emergency deal Monday in which Citadel LLC, its partners and Point72 Asset Management would immediately invest $2.75 billion into Melvin's fund to help stabilize it. Melvin was completely out of GameStop stock on Tuesday. "Melvin Capital has repositioned our portfolio over the past few days," a spokesman said in a written statement. He declined to comment on how much of Melvin's losses came from GameStop.
5. Individual investors are jeering at professionals on social media.
Buying GameStop has turned into a way for some users to way to confront institutional money. Chatter about "Melvin" has been dominant on Reddit, according to an analysis by Meltwater , a global media intelligence company, with more than 40,000 posts tied to the firm circulating over the past month. On Jan. 19, a Twitter account identifying itself as moderators for WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum where traders boast about rallying stocks such as GameStop, posted that the forum had long been dismissed, but "we are also now a powerful force to be taken seriously." Some WallStreetBets posters have targeted Andrew Left of Citron Research, who made his bearish position on GameStop public. He said throngs of people on the internet have trolled him and some have harassed his family members, including his children. Many people ridiculed him as a "boomer," he said.
6. Some professional investors are calling foul.
Many traders have been questioning whether users who have been posting about the company and urging others to buy shares and calls could be considered a "group" by the SEC's definition. The "group" designation could require regulatory disclosures for investors acting together on a particular stock and at certain thresholds restrict trading and require a return of some short-term profits. Hedge funds and their clients also have been asking whether the activity could be considered market manipulation. SEC staff is likely looking into the trading activity and messages on Reddit, said Brad Bennett, a former enforcement chief at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Proving any type of fraud, such as market manipulation, would require showing that traders conveyed false or misleading information to goose the stock price, he said. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. Moderators on Reddit investing and trading forums have disputed in posts the notion that the forum manipulates markets, and in replies to users have said they are strict on enforcing group rules, which "relate to promotions and pump and dumps," one moderator said in a forum this month. Some individual investors have also questioned to what extent retail traders are driving the massive share-price increases.

GameStop Is a Bubble in Its Purest Form; It is tempting to see GameStop's soaring stock as merely the result of clownish behavior in a chat room. That would be a mistake.

Full text: GameStop is the platonic ideal of a stock bubble.
A combination of easy money, a real improvement in the company's prospects, technical support from a short squeeze and a mad rush to get rich or die trying pushed stock in the retailer up 64-fold from late August to Wednesday's close. Anyone who has held on for 10 days made gains of more than 10 times their money.
It is tempting to see GameStop as merely clownish behavior in a chat room having some amusing effects on a stock few care about. That would be a mistake.
Sure, the wildly popular Reddit group WallStreetBets—slogan: like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal—is full of childish chat. Several users report that they have bet their parents' pension fund on GameStop. There are plenty of calls for the stock to go to $1,000 or more (it started the year at $18.84).
But GameStop's soaring stock— and similar moves in BlackBerry, Nokia and others—is a bubble in microcosm, with lessons for those of us worrying about froth elsewhere in the market.
GameStop's rise started with some genuinely good news, just as bubbles always do. Ryan Cohen, who built up and sold online pet-food retailer Chewy, started building what is now a 13% stake for his RC Ventures in GameStop last year. He pushed for the staid mall-based seller of videogames to improve its internet sales. This month he joined the board.
Mr. Cohen's arrival means GameStop at least has a chance of joining the 21st century. From the first disclosure of his stock purchases in August to the end of November the shares tripled, helped too by the improved prospects for the vaccine-driven reopening of the economy.
Along the way, some private investors latched on to the stock, helping its rise, anand it became an item of discussion on Wall Street Bets, or r/WSB as it is known.
This month the stock moved into the pure speculative phase, producing several daily jumps of 50% or more, and fundamentals were abandoned. Many cheerleaders on r/WSB stopped even making the pretense of arguments about Mr. Cohen's chances of turning the company around. Instead, there were two justifications for buying: wanting to get in on the price action to avoid being ridiculed as someone who missed gigantic profits, and the self-fulfilling prospect of hurting the large numbers of short sellers.
As the late economist Charles Kindleberger put it: "There is nothing as disturbing to one's well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich. Unless it is to see a non-friend get rich."
The scale of trading in GameStop shares is as extraordinary as the daily gains in price, suggesting widespread disturbance to people's judgment. On Tuesday, $22 billion of shares changed hands, more than in Apple, the world's largest company, and double GameStop's market value. Adam Smith, the founder of economics, called speculative manias "overtrading," and this is what they look like.
The hope of getting rich is only part of what is inflating the bubble. Mr. Kindleberger argued that speculative manias needed innovative sources of financing, and the private traders on r/WSB have one: the shift last year to make trading in options free on Robinhood and several other platforms.
Options, like other derivatives, allow traders to use implied leverage to boost their bets, similar to borrowing money. In the same way that Japan's bubble in the 1980s was fueled by cheap mortgages and low Federal Reserve rates combined with collateralized debt obligations to support the housing bubble of the 2000s, the bubble in GameStop is aided by an increase in the money supply of private stock traders. Stimulus checks from the government can't hurt, either.
Bubbles also frequently have support from technical factors that prevent the asset from being priced correctly. In the late 1990s, many dot-coms had a small float available, and none for short sellers, making it hard or impossible for those who doubted the story to have their views expressed in the share price.
In GameStop, there are plenty of short sellers, but they are making things even worse. The stock is caught in a vicious short squeeze. Short sellers had borrowed and sold more than 100% of the stock outstanding, as some was borrowed again. As the price rose, at least some of the hedge funds bought back shares to prevent further losses, so pushing the price up even further.
The most obvious parallel here is to K-Tel, the TV retailer of compilation tapes and the Veg-O-Matic food processor, among other things. It announced in 1998 that it was moving online, prompting a jump in the shares that turned into an extraordinary short squeeze. K-Tel's appropriately named public-relations representative, Coffin Communications, gave this wonderful justification to the Washington Post: "Which do you think has more likelihood of success, a pure start-up that has never sold a product, or one like K-Tel that has been in business for 35 years?"
It turned out the answer was a pure startup, and K-Tel's shares collapsed—but not before they had soared from $3.34 to more than $35 in under a month.
The difference with GameStop is that the r/WSB mob is actively engineering a short squeeze, discussing the pain they hoped to inflict on the short sellers and encouraging buyers not to cash in their profits.
Because there are so many shares that need to be repurchased by short sellers, this offers an exit route for those who sell. But not everyone can do this, and those who are left holding the stock when demand eventually evaporates will watch the price plummet as it reverts back to something closer to what is justified by the company's profit potential, just as K-Tel did.
Warren Buffett attributed to his mentor, Ben Graham, the line that "in the short run, the market is a voting machine—reflecting a voter-registration test that requires only money, not intelligence or emotional stability—but in the long run, the market is a weighing machine."
The absence of emotional stability on r/WSB is obvious and has worked out beautifully for buyers of GameStop so far. But when the stock is weighed, many will be found wanting, as they always are in bubbles.

June 10 2020: GameStop Reports First Quarter Results
GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today reported sales and earnings for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020.
George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, "During this unprecedented time, our priority is focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and business partners as we continue the process of opening our stores as restrictions are lifted, in our ongoing effort to meet our customers' needs. We are proud of our team's ability to quickly adapt to meet the increased demand for our product offerings. As the pandemic spread, we leaned in on our upgraded omni-channel capabilities to fulfill customer orders through curbside pick-up where available, we reduced discretionary spending and enhanced our liquidity while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. While we delivered a loss for the quarter in total, our performance included total sales just shy of our original expectations, even as stores closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and key video game titles shifted to the second and third quarters, exacerbating the headwind from operating in the final stage of a console cycle. Even more impressive is that our e-commerce sales grew 519% in the first quarter and over 1,000% during the six weeks that our store base temporarily closed to customer access. We believe this reflects the loyalty of the GameStop customer and the confidence they place in us as their preferred place to shop."

Importantly, the U.S.-based stores conducting this limited curbside offering were able to meet or exceed their sales plans during the second half of the quarter which is a true testament to our ability to fully capitalize on both our omni-channel capabilities and our leadership position in gaming. I would like to thank all of our associates and business partners for their dedication and commitment during this unprecedented time. We have begun safely reopening our stores around the world as conditions and government regulations permit, and look forward to the day our fleet can be fully operational again. We believe we have, and are continuing to, take the appropriate steps to preserve liquidity, including disciplined management of all expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures as we continue to manage through the current environment, positioning the Company to emerge even stronger when in-store operations resume in totality."

(NYSE: GME) (the "Company") today filed its definitive proxy statement and issued a letter to stockholders highlighting the successful results generated by its strategy of effective execution and thoughtful capital allocation, as well as the guidance of its comprehensively refreshed, independent Board of Directors (the "Board"). This recently refreshed Board already includes two directors proposed pursuant to the previous cooperative agreement reached with Hestia Capital Partners, LP and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund, LP ("Hestia Capital" and "Permit Capital," or collectively, "Hestia and Permit"). The letter urges stockholders to use the BLUE proxy card to vote "FOR ALL" of GameStop's 10 highly qualified director nominees in connection with the Company's upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at 8:00 a.m. CT on June 12, 2020.

Dear GameStop Stockholders,
Thank you for your investment in our Company. You are being asked to make a critical decision at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled for June 12, 2020 (the "Annual Meeting"). Hestia Capital Partners, LP and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund, LP ("Hestia Capital" and "Permit Capital," or collectively, "Hestia and Permit") are running a costly and distracting proxy fight in an attempt to remove your independent and highly qualified directors.

April 21: GameStop Provides Business Update Related to COVID-19
GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 21, 2020 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced business updates related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
George Sherman, GameStop's Chief Executive Officer, said, "As we continue to navigate these unprecedented times, our priority has been and continues to be on the well-being of our employees, customers and business partners. I am very proud of the resilience that our teams are showing during this time. In very short order, we implemented a temporary curbside pick-up process at the majority of our U.S. stores in accordance with state and local ordinances. By using our omni-channel buy online pickup in store and ship from store capabilities, we are able to operate in a safe and regulatory compliant way while meeting the increased demand for our products as more consumers work, learn, and play from home. Importantly, since we closed stores to the public on March 22nd, through omni-channel fulfillment, we have retained over 90%1 of our planned sales volumes in the two-thirds of our stores that are conducting curbside operations. We believe this speaks to the strength of our enhanced omni-channel capabilities implemented in the fall of last year."
Mr. Sherman continued, "We continue to proactively manage our business with a goal to increase financial flexibility and preserve cash flow in the current environment. Today, we announced salary reductions for our senior management team and board of directors, as well as wage rate reductions for some other corporate and field support staff. In addition, we have offered certain corporate and other support team members the option to work under either half-time/half-pay structure or a temporary furlough program. We believe our aggressive focus on expense, inventory and capital expenditure reductions will help preserve our financial health as we work to ensure readiness and ramp up operations as soon as conditions allow."

George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, "Our third quarter results continue to reflect the prevailing industry trends, most notably the unprecedented decline in new hardware sales seen across the market as the current generation of gaming consoles reach the end of their lifecycle and consumers delay their spending in anticipation of new hardware releases. With console makers set to introduce new and innovative gaming consoles late next year, we anticipate this trend to continue until the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite the current top-line trends, we are pleased with the continued strong progress that we are making against our strategic initiatives as we transform GameStop for the future. We remain on track to achieve our $200 million annualized operating profit improvement goal, by 2021 and we believe our strategic initiatives will enable to us to achieve our long-term growth and profit objectives as we fully leverage our unique leadership position and brand in the video game space."
Mr. Sherman continued, "Since July, we have repurchased more than one-third of our outstanding shares, underscoring our continued conviction in the long-term value proposition of GameStop, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and deliver positive cash flows, as well as our commitment of returning capital to shareholders."

December 10 2019: GameStop Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Results and Updates Fiscal 2019 Guidance
Repurchased 22.6 Million Shares for $115.7 Million During the Quarter, Underscoring Commitment to Returning Capital to Shareholders
GRAPEVINE, Texas, Dec. 10, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today reported sales, earnings and share repurchase activity for the third quarter ended November 2, 2019, and issued updated guidance for fiscal 2019.
George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, "Our third quarter results continue to reflect the prevailing industry trends, most notably the unprecedented decline in new hardware sales seen across the market as the current generation of gaming consoles reach the end of their lifecycle and consumers delay their spending in anticipation of new hardware releases. With console makers set to introduce new and innovative gaming consoles late next year, we anticipate this trend to continue until the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite the current top-line trends, we are pleased with the continued strong progress that we are making against our strategic initiatives as we transform GameStop for the future. We remain on track to achieve our $200 million annualized operating profit improvement goal, by 2021 and we believe our strategic initiatives will enable to us to achieve our long-term growth and profit objectives as we fully leverage our unique leadership position and brand in the video game space."
Mr. Sherman continued, "Since July, we have repurchased more than one-third of our outstanding shares, underscoring our continued conviction in the long-term value proposition of GameStop, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and deliver positive cash flows, as well as our commitment of returning capital to shareholders."

"The new leadership appointments and changes to our organizational structure mark important milestones that will help advance GameStop's transformation as we work to position the company for the future and bring gaming culture and experiences to life in every community," George said.

(NYSE: GME) today announced the final results of its "modified Dutch auction" tender offer to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The tender offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 10, 2019.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer and based on the final count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, GameStop accepted for payment, at a purchase price of $5.20 per share, a total of 12,000,000 shares properly tendered at the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of $62,400,000, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. GameStop accepted the shares on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of "odd lots," which were accepted in full, and conditional tenders that were automatically regarded as withdrawn because the condition of the tender was not met, and has been informed by the depositary that the final proration factor for the tender offer is 43.14%. The shares purchased represent approximately 11.72% of GameStop's Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of July 10, 2019.
The depositary will promptly pay for all shares accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer, and will return to the tendering shareholders all other shares tendered and not purchased.
While GameStop suspended open market repurchase activity under its existing share repurchase program initiated in March 2019, the completion of the tender offer removes that suspension. However, under applicable securities laws, GameStop may not repurchase any shares until July 25, 2019. After taking into account the completion of the tender offer, the company has $237,600,000 repurchase capacity remaining under the share repurchase program.

GRAPEVINE, Texas, July 15, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today announced a strategic partnership with global innovation design firm, R/GA, to strengthen its focus on creating unique in-store experiences as part of its strategic move in re-affirming its place in the video gaming culture.
The partnership with R/GA's Austin and Chicago teams is part of GameStop's broader business transformation strategy to evolve its efforts in cultivating innovative customer-centric opportunities to bring video game culture to life in every neighborhood. GameStop's renewed customer-first focus stems from qualitative and quantitative research led by GameStop and R/GA that identified four major motivations gaming fans have for playing video games - immersion, achievement, creativity and community.
Together, GameStop and R/GA are developing and piloting new and streamlined physical store concepts, introducing new ways for gamers to try new titles before they buy them, and giving stores a unique layout and purpose that appeal to gamers. From store concepts that offer competitive sessions in home-grown e-Leagues to locations that sell strictly retro gaming software and hardware, GameStop will pilot the new store concepts in a select market to present something new to players both old and new, and searching for experiences in gaming beyond the console.
"We're on a journey to use our vast retail footprint to provide an engaging and well-thought-out experience that enhances our consumers' gaming interests. Among its many strengths is R/GA's ability to leverage consumer insights and technology to reimagine the experience our consumers can have in our physical space. Our investment in this partnership is the next stage of our transformation and growth strategy," said Frank Hamlin, Chief Customer Officer at GameStop.

April 05 2019: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the Company will appoint an independent director from among the candidates nominated by Hestia and Permit.

It is anticipated that the two new directors will join the Board on or before April 30, 2019.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two new independent directors will be included in the Company's slate of directors standing for election at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

March 29 2019: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today confirmed that Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia"), which owns approximately 160,000 shares of GameStop common stock, provided notice of its intent to nominate four individuals to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

March 28 2019: GameStop Earns Top Marks in 2019 Corporate Equality Index; Yielding a Perfect Scorecard on The Annual LGBTQ Workplace Survey
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop is proud to announce that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. This represents the eighth consecutive year the company has been awarded a perfect score in the annual workplace survey.
"The top-scoring companies on this year's CEI are not only establishing policies that affirm and include employees here in the United States, they are applying these policies to their global operations and impacting millions of people beyond our shores," said HRC President Chad Griffin. "Many of these companies have also become vocal advocates for equality in the public square, including the dozens that have signed on to amicus briefs in vital Supreme Court cases and the more than 170 that have joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests. It's important to our organization that we celebrate the quality and individuality of every person we serve in and out of our organization."
The 2019 CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community.

March 28 2019: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

GRAPEVINE, Texas, July 15, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced the final results of its "modified Dutch auction" tender offer to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The tender offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 10, 2019.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer and based on the final count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, GameStop accepted for payment, at a purchase price of $5.20 per share, a total of 12,000,000 shares properly tendered at the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of $62,400,000, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. GameStop accepted the shares on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of "odd lots," which were accepted in full, and conditional tenders that were automatically regarded as withdrawn because the condition of the tender was not met, and has been informed by the depositary that the final proration factor for the tender offer is 43.14%. The shares purchased represent approximately 11.72% of GameStop's Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of July 10, 2019.
The depositary will promptly pay for all shares accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer, and will return to the tendering shareholders all other shares tendered and not purchased.
While GameStop suspended open market repurchase activity under its existing share repurchase program initiated in March 2019, the completion of the tender offer removes that suspension. However, under applicable securities laws, GameStop may not repurchase any shares until July 25, 2019. After taking into account the completion of the tender offer, the company has $237,600,000 repurchase capacity remaining under the share repurchase program.

The partnership with R/GA's Austin and Chicago teams is part of GameStop's broader business transformation strategy to evolve its efforts in cultivating innovative customer-centric opportunities to bring video game culture to life in every neighborhood. GameStop's renewed customer-first focus stems from qualitative and quantitative research led by GameStop and R/GA that identified four major motivations gaming fans have for playing video games - immersion, achievement, creativity and community.
Together, GameStop and R/GA are developing and piloting new and streamlined physical store concepts, introducing new ways for gamers to try new titles before they buy them, and giving stores a unique layout and purpose that appeal to gamers. From store concepts that offer competitive sessions in home-grown e-Leagues to locations that sell strictly retro gaming software and hardware, GameStop will pilot the new store concepts in a select market to present something new to players both old and new, and searching for experiences in gaming beyond the console.
"We're on a journey to use our vast retail footprint to provide an engaging and well-thought-out experience that enhances our consumers' gaming interests. Among its many strengths is R/GA's ability to leverage consumer insights and technology to reimagine the experience our consumers can have in our physical space. Our investment in this partnership is the next stage of our transformation and growth strategy," said Frank Hamlin, Chief Customer Officer at GameStop.

GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 15, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) announced the issuance today of restricted stock awards to George Sherman, its new Chief Executive Officer. Consistent with the disclosures contained in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2019, these awards were issued to induce Mr. Sherman to enter into employment with GameStop and were issued outside of GameStop's stockholder approved equity incentive plan, in reliance on the inducement award exception contained in NYSE Listing Rule 303A.08. GameStop is issuing this press release pursuant to NYSE Listing Rule 303A.08.
The awards to Mr. Sherman consist of 587,249 shares of time-based restricted stock and 587,248 shares of performance-based restricted stock. The 587,248 shares of performance-based restricted stock represent the number of shares that would be earned at target levels of performance (the "Target Shares"). The actual number of shares that may be earned in respect of the performance-based portion of the awards will vary between 0 to 200% of the Target Shares, depending on actual performance, with any above-target shares being issued at the time that performance is determined.
The inducement awards were made outside of GameStop's Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Plan, but have terms generally consistent with the relevant terms of that plan. The time-based portion of the awards will vest in three equal annual installments, on the first, second and third anniversaries of today (the "Grant Date"), subject to Mr. Sherman's continuous service with GameStop through the applicable vesting date. The performance goals applicable to the performance-based portion of the awards have not yet been determined.

April 05: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

April 01: GameStop Announces Agreement with Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise Capital Partners
Two New Independent Directors to Join GameStop Board of Directors
GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 01, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced that it has reached a cooperation agreement with Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP ("Permit") under which two new independent directors will be added to the GameStop Board of Directors. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the Company will appoint an independent director from among the candidates nominated by Hestia and Permit. As part of the Board's ongoing refreshment and search efforts, the Board will appoint an additional independent director who will be selected by the Board in consultation with Hestia and Permit. It is anticipated that the two new directors will join the Board on or before April 30, 2019.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two new independent directors will be included in the Company's slate of directors standing for election at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The director nominated by Hestia and Permit will join the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees upon election. Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the GameStop Board will comprise 11 directors, nine of whom are independent.
Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Hestia and Permit have agreed to withdraw their director nominations for GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting, effective as of the date of the appointment of one of their nominees. They will respectively vote their shares in favor of all of GameStop's director nominees at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting and have agreed to abide by customary standstill provisions.

March 29: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today confirmed that Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia"), which owns approximately 160,000 shares of GameStop common stock, provided notice of its intent to nominate four individuals to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

Releasing on March 31, this Only at GameStop controller designed by PowerA will help raise funds in support of autism awareness.
PowerA Design Manager, Brandon Smith's personal experience raising a young son with autism and interacting with friends and families within the autism community influenced the design of the controller. With each purchase of the controller, GameStop Gives will donate a portion of the profits to the nonPareil Institute to help teach adults with autism digital technology skills in various domains and work toward building games and items for the digital marketplace. One of the games developed by nonPareil Institute Crew, To Catch A Monkey, will also be provided for free with each purchase of the GameStop Gives controller.
"GameStop is committed to supporting the autism community and spreading the power of gaming for good. We hope the powerful message behind the development and design of this unique controller resonates and makes the end-user feel good about gaming and its ability to be inclusive," said Eric Bright, VP of merchandising at GameStop.

GameStop will be taking donations at checkout to benefit Autism Speaks and its NXT GEN Coders Program, and nonPareil Institute. Last year's fundraising campaign launched the NXT GEN Coders Program powered by GameStop, which awarded $250,000 in grants to 14 organizations from coast to coast.

March 28: GameStop Earns Top Marks in 2019 Corporate Equality Index; Yielding a Perfect Scorecard on The Annual LGBTQ Workplace Survey
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop is proud to announce that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. This represents the eighth consecutive year the company has been awarded a perfect score in the annual workplace survey.
"The top-scoring companies on this year's CEI are not only establishing policies that affirm and include employees here in the United States, they are applying these policies to their global operations and impacting millions of people beyond our shores," said HRC President Chad Griffin. "Many of these companies have also become vocal advocates for equality in the public square, including the dozens that have signed on to amicus briefs in vital Supreme Court cases and the more than 170 that have joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests. It's important to our organization that we celebrate the quality and individuality of every person we serve in and out of our organization."
The 2019 CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community.

March 28: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

GRAPEVINE, Texas, May 30, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced new leadership appointments and an enhanced organizational structure to better position the company for continued execution of its transformation and drive its next phase of growth. Under the enhanced organizational structure, which includes newly created Chief Customer Officer and Chief Merchandising Officer roles, the leadership team will report directly to George Sherman, who was appointed as Chief Executive Officer last month.
Collectively, the additions and changes to GameStop's leadership bring together a strong group of individuals with complementary experience, deep industry and operational expertise and proven records of execution. These include:
"The new leadership appointments and changes to our organizational structure mark important milestones that will help advance GameStop's transformation as we work to position the company for the future and bring gaming culture and experiences to life in every community," George said. "With this experienced and dynamic team in place, we will be better positioned than ever to execute on our strategic priorities and meet our loyal customers where, when and how they want to shop. Importantly, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and profitability and further strengthening our balance sheet to deliver increased value to our shareholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders."
George added, "On behalf of the entire GameStop Board of Directors and leadership team, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Rob for his significant contributions to GameStop in his nearly 23-year career with the company. Rob helped transform GameStop from a retail-only, single focus retailer to an omni-channel enterprise with multiple retail brands and product sets.

12.2.7 Performance
July 15: GameStop Announces Final Results of its Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer
GRAPEVINE, Texas, July 15, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today announced the final results of its "modified Dutch auction" tender offer to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The tender offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 10, 2019.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer and based on the final count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, GameStop accepted for payment, at a purchase price of $5.20 per share, a total of 12,000,000 shares properly tendered at the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of $62,400,000, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. GameStop accepted the shares on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of "odd lots," which were accepted in full, and conditional tenders that were automatically regarded as withdrawn because the condition of the tender was not met, and has been informed by the depositary that the final proration factor for the tender offer is 43.14%. The shares purchased represent approximately 11.72% of GameStop's Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of July 10, 2019.
The depositary will promptly pay for all shares accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer, and will return to the tendering shareholders all other shares tendered and not purchased.
While GameStop suspended open market repurchase activity under its existing share repurchase program initiated in March 2019, the completion of the tender offer removes that suspension. However, under applicable securities laws, GameStop may not repurchase any shares until July 25, 2019. After taking into account the completion of the tender offer, the company has $237,600,000 repurchase capacity remaining under the share repurchase program.

The partnership with R/GA's Austin and Chicago teams is part of GameStop's broader business transformation strategy to evolve its efforts in cultivating innovative customer-centric opportunities to bring video game culture to life in every neighborhood. GameStop's renewed customer-first focus stems from qualitative and quantitative research led by GameStop and R/GA that identified four major motivations gaming fans have for playing video games - immersion, achievement, creativity and community.
Together, GameStop and R/GA are developing and piloting new and streamlined physical store concepts, introducing new ways for gamers to try new titles before they buy them, and giving stores a unique layout and purpose that appeal to gamers. From store concepts that offer competitive sessions in home-grown e-Leagues to locations that sell strictly retro gaming software and hardware, GameStop will pilot the new store concepts in a select market to present something new to players both old and new, and searching for experiences in gaming beyond the console.
"We're on a journey to use our vast retail footprint to provide an engaging and well-thought-out experience that enhances our consumers' gaming interests. Among its many strengths is R/GA's ability to leverage consumer insights and technology to reimagine the experience our consumers can have in our physical space. Our investment in this partnership is the next stage of our transformation and growth strategy," said Frank Hamlin, Chief Customer Officer at GameStop.

April 05: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the Company will appoint an independent director from among the candidates nominated by Hestia and Permit.

It is anticipated that the two new directors will join the Board on or before April 30, 2019.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two new independent directors will be included in the Company's slate of directors standing for election at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The director nominated by Hestia and Permit will join the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees upon election.

Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Hestia and Permit have agreed to withdraw their director nominations for GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting, effective as of the date of the appointment of one of their nominees.

March 29: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today confirmed that Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia"), which owns approximately 160,000 shares of GameStop common stock, provided notice of its intent to nominate four individuals to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

Releasing on March 31, this Only at GameStop controller designed by PowerA will help raise funds in support of autism awareness.
PowerA Design Manager, Brandon Smith's personal experience raising a young son with autism and interacting with friends and families within the autism community influenced the design of the controller. With each purchase of the controller, GameStop Gives will donate a portion of the profits to the nonPareil Institute to help teach adults with autism digital technology skills in various domains and work toward building games and items for the digital marketplace. One of the games developed by nonPareil Institute Crew, To Catch A Monkey, will also be provided for free with each purchase of the GameStop Gives controller.
"GameStop is committed to supporting the autism community and spreading the power of gaming for good. We hope the powerful message behind the development and design of this unique controller resonates and makes the end-user feel good about gaming and its ability to be inclusive," said Eric Bright, VP of merchandising at GameStop.

March 28: GameStop Earns Top Marks in 2019 Corporate Equality Index; Yielding a Perfect Scorecard on The Annual LGBTQ Workplace Survey
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop is proud to announce that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. This represents the eighth consecutive year the company has been awarded a perfect score in the annual workplace survey.
"The top-scoring companies on this year's CEI are not only establishing policies that affirm and include employees here in the United States, they are applying these policies to their global operations and impacting millions of people beyond our shores," said HRC President Chad Griffin. "Many of these companies have also become vocal advocates for equality in the public square, including the dozens that have signed on to amicus briefs in vital Supreme Court cases and the more than 170 that have joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests. It's important to our organization that we celebrate the quality and individuality of every person we serve in and out of our organization."
The 2019 CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community.

March 28: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

April 05: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

March 29: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today confirmed that Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia"), which owns approximately 160,000 shares of GameStop common stock, provided notice of its intent to nominate four individuals to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

Releasing on March 31, this Only at GameStop controller designed by PowerA will help raise funds in support of autism awareness.
PowerA Design Manager, Brandon Smith's personal experience raising a young son with autism and interacting with friends and families within the autism community influenced the design of the controller.

March 28: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop is proud to announce that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation.

Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests.

April 05: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

March 29: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) today confirmed that Hestia Capital Partners LP ("Hestia"), which owns approximately 160,000 shares of GameStop common stock, provided notice of its intent to nominate four individuals to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors at GameStop's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

Releasing on March 31, this Only at GameStop controller designed by PowerA will help raise funds in support of autism awareness.
PowerA Design Manager, Brandon Smith's personal experience raising a young son with autism and interacting with friends and families within the autism community influenced the design of the controller.

March 28: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests.

April 05: Financialbuzz.com: 'Market Recap' Week Ending April 5th, 2019
NEW YORK, April 5, 2019 -- U.S. markets opened stronger on Monday following better-than-expected China manufacturing data, suppressing investors fears of a slowing global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied throughout Monday, gaining 328.2 points or 1.2% throughout the day. Monday's rally was also attributable to China's decision on Sunday to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts in order to "create a good atmosphere for the continuing trade negotiations between both sides," according to Reuters. On Tuesday, markets remained flat, primarily due to Walgreens' weaker-than-expected financial results. Despite Walgreens' quarterly results, U.S. markets were offset as Monday's rally continued into Tuesday. On Wednesday, markets began the day stronger then quickly faded by the afternoon. Markets opened stronger due to reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a final trade deal. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. and China trade negotiations were mostly wrapped up, as China's Vice Premier Liu He met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday. The Dow Jones rose by 152.1 points on Thursday morning as trade war discussions were in focus again and President Donald Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday to further discuss trade matters. The optimistic trade talks this week pushed the Dow Jones by 442.88 to 26,388.80 from Monday's opening bell into late morning Thursday, nearly reaching a six-month high. The S&P 500 rose by 43.9 points or 1.5% in the same period, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 169.9 points or 2.1%. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), GameStop Corp.

March 29: GameStop Comments on Director Nominations
GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 29, 2019 -- GameStop Corp.

The Company's 2019 Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled and no shareholder action is required at this time.
The Company issued the following statement:
GameStop welcomes open communications with its shareholders and values constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Over the past several weeks, members of GameStop's Board and the Company's advisors have had extensive correspondence and held multiple discussions with Hestia, Permit Capital and their representatives to better understand their views.
GameStop Proposed Settlement Agreement Rejected by Hestia and PermitGameStop approached discussions with Hestia and Permit earnestly and in good faith. We offered to nominate one of their proposed candidates and appoint an additional independent director to the Board, in consultation with Hestia and Permit. These two additions, in conjunction with the Board appointments of George Sherman, our new Chief Executive Officer, in April 2019, and independent director Carrie Teffner, in August 2018, would have resulted in the election of four new directors to GameStop's Board within approximately eight months. In order to advance this effort and to avoid unnecessary expense and distraction associated with a proxy fight, we asked Hestia to provide names of proposed directors for Board consideration. Despite our efforts to be constructive and responsive, Hestia and Permit declined to provide information on director candidates, other than Hestia managing member Kurt Wolf, and rejected our proposal.

March 28: Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital Announce Nomination of a Slate of Highly-Qualified, Independent Individuals for Election to the Board of GameStop Corp (GME).
PITTSBURGH, March 28, 2019 -- Hestia Capital Partners LP (together with its affiliates, "Hestia Capital") and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP (together with its affiliates, "Permit Enterprise"), are long-term stockholders of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company"), with a combined ownership of approximately 1.3% of outstanding stock. Hestia Capital and Permit Enterprise (the "Investor Group") today announced that Hestia Capital has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified candidates: Don C. Bell III, Christopher P. Carvalho, Lizabeth Dunn, and Kurtis J. Wolf, for election to the board of directors of GameStop (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Hestia Capital currently contemplates running three of the four nominees.
Permit Enterprise and Hestia Capital are deep value investors, have been invested in the Company since 2011 and 2012, respectively, and do not typically engage in activism as a part of their investment strategies. Nevertheless, the ongoing value destruction at the Company, combined with the Board's reluctance to directly engage with the Investor Group since Hestia Capital'sFebruary 12, 2019 letter (link) and the Investor Group'sMarch 13, 2019 letter (link) has left the Investor Group with no alternative but to pursue change via a proxy contest.
Kurt Wolf, Managing Member of Hestia Capital said, "Our hope had been to work constructively with the Company, and we had purposely kept our public communications as positive as possible. We are surprised and disappointed that during this process the Board hasn't given us more than 30 minutes to talk with two Board Members - a conversation where it seemed the Company's advisor did the majority of their talking. They've otherwise referred us to speak with their legal and financial advisors."

GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 28, 2019 -- GameStop is proud to announce that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. This represents the eighth consecutive year the company has been awarded a perfect score in the annual workplace survey.

"Many of these companies have also become vocal advocates for equality in the public square, including the dozens that have signed on to amicus briefs in vital Supreme Court cases and the more than 170 that have joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn't just the right thing to do -- it's also good for business."
"We are honored to have received this award for the eighth consecutive year," said Lisa Keglovitz, senior vice president of Human Resources at GameStop. "Our commitment to the unique life experiences and incredible value of the LGBTQ community has spanned many years, and we are always challenging ourselves to improve how we honor the voice and importance of our LGBTQ associates and guests. It's important to our organization that we celebrate the quality and individuality of every person we serve in and out of our organization."
The 2019 CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community.

Full text: GameStop Corp. has named George Sherman as its next chief executive, ending a monthslong search for a candidate to lead the videogame retailer.
Mr. Sherman will take on the CEO role on April 15 and join the board of directors, the company said Thursday. He will be the company's fifth CEO since November 2017.
Mr. Sherman is a former chief of Victra, an authorized retailer of Verizon Wireless products and services. At GameStop, he succeeds Shane Kim, who has been the interim CEO since May 2018.
GameStop has been searching for a permanent CEO since former Chief Executive Michael Mauler abruptly quit last year, citing personal reasons, after only three months in the job.
Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported two GameStop shareholders were threatening a proxy fight, if the retailer didn't overhaul its board of directors and take other steps to improve its performance after an attempt to sell the company didn't pan out.
Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP and Hestia Capital Partners LP, who have a combined 1.3% stake in GameStop, want the company to refresh its board and boost stock buybacks, according to a letter to the board.
GameStop ended a monthslong search for a buyer for the company in January.
GameStop's sales have been stuck at around $9 billion in recent years as consumers have increased the amount of games they buy digitally.

Abstract: "The bottom line is that GameStop is fighting to diversify into new businesses as the core console game industry faces challenges," said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. Elsewhere,BlackRock shares rose 0.3 per cent to $379.35 after the asset manager posted better than expected fourth-quarter profits and said net inflows reached a record $202bn last year, even as revenues for the quarter missed analysts' estimates.

Full text: Shares of video game retailerGameStop took a hit on Friday after the company reported downbeat revenues during a nine-week holiday period and analysts at Macquarie downgraded the stock.
GameStop shares fell 8.1 per cent to $22.73, taking its losses over the past year to 11 per cent, after the company said like-for-like sales tumbled 18.7 per cent, though the decline slowed from a 26.6 per cent drop in November to 13 per cent the following month.
Total global revenues fell more than 16 per cent to $2.5bn.
The Texas-based retailer attributed the drop to weak Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare/ and Titanfall 2/ sales and aggressive discounting on its consoles during Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday.
Paul Raines, chief executive, said he was "disappointed" with the results but expects its non-physical gaming business to grow.
He added that the company was "focused on our transformation plan, which includes growing our non-gaming businesses, right-sizing our global store portfolio by continuously evaluating non-productive stores for closure, and maintaining strong financial discipline, including reducing SG & A by $100m by 2019".
Sentiment on the stock soured further after analysts at Macquarie downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "buy" and cut the price target to $23 from $27.
"The bottom line is that GameStop is fighting to diversify into new businesses as the core console game industry faces challenges," said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie.
He added: "While the shift to digital is reasonably well understood, our caution on GameStop has more to do with uncertainty around core franchises, new hardware, and used. We simply do not have confidence that GameStop or anyone can accurately forecast console market growth in 2017 and beyond."
The sell-off came as bank results helped lift US stocks higher. At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 2,274.6, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 19,885.7. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 5,574.1.
The S&P 500 financial sector was the biggest gainer on the benchmark index, rising 0.6 per cent, afterJPMorganandBank of Americasaid profitsjumpedin the final quarter of 2016, sending their shares up 0.5 per cent to $86.70 and 0.4 per cent to $23.01, respectively.
Meanwhile,Wells Fargorounded off a difficult year with a drop in fourth-quarter earnings but its shares advanced 1.5 per cent to $55.31.
Elsewhere,BlackRock shares rose 0.3 per cent to $379.35 after the asset manager posted better than expected fourth-quarter profits and said net inflows reached a record $202bn last year, even as revenues for the quarter missed analysts' estimates.
Shares inMonster Beveragejumped 3.3 per cent to $44.51 after a number of analysts signalled increased confidence in the company after its investor meeting after the market close on Thursday.
"We walked away even more confident in the key elements of our positive thesis, including the transition to the Coke distribution system internationally and the rollout of Mutant," said Laurent Grandet, an analyst at Credit Suisse. Mutant is the drink Monster launched last year to rival Mountain Dew.

Full text:   M2 PRESSWIRE-May 27, 2013-Market Maker Surveillance Report. MRGE, GME, HIHO, VCBI, DF, STV, Losing Stocks With Lowest Price Friction For Friday, May 24th 2013
(C)2013 M2 COMMUNICATIONS http://www.m2.com
May 25, 2013
BUYINS.NET / www.buyins.net, announced today its proprietary Market Maker Friction Factor Report for Friday. Since October 2008 market makers are now required to be on the bid as much as they are on the offer and for like amounts of stock. This Fair Market Making Requirement is designed to prevent market makers from manipulating stock prices. On Friday there were 3967 companies with "abnormal" market making, 2393 companies with positive Friction Factors and 2689 companies with negative Friction Factors. Here is a list of the top companies with the largest percentage loss per share Friday and low price friction (bearish). This means that there was more selling than buying in the stocks and their stock prices dropped faster with less Friction. Merge Healthcare Inc (NASDAQ:MRGE), GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), Highway Holdings Ltd (NASDAQ:HIHO), Virginia Commerce Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:VCBI), Dean Foods Co (NYSE:DF), China Digital Tv Holding Co Ltd (NYSE:STV). To access Friction Factor, Naked Short Data and SqueezeTrigger Prices on all stocks please visit http://www.buyins.net .
Market Maker Friction Factor is shown in the chart below:
Symbol Change Percent Buy Volume Buy %% Sell Volume Sell %% Net Volume Friction
MRGE $-0.310 -9.39% 157,524 40.08% 224,642 57.15% -67,118 -2,165
GME $-3.840 -10.66% 4,180,063 30.19% 4,315,862 31.17% -135,799 -354
HIHO $-0.350 -15.56% 80,574 38.99% 126,075 61.01% -45,501 -1,300
VCBI $-1.920 -14.20% 27,789 35.47% 50,552 64.53% -22,763 -119
DF $-10.310 -50.51% 4,402,209 29.83% 4,410,586 29.89% -8,377 -8
STV $-0.160 -8.70% 108,763 28.93% 171,259 45.55% -62,496 -3,906
Analysis of the Friction Factor chart above shows that each of the six stocks mentioned above have high net dollar losses (Change) and extremely low price friction in their stocks. The Friction Factor displays how many more shares of buying than selling are required to move a stock higher by one cent or how many more shares of selling than buying moves a stock lower by 1 cent.
For example, the chart above shows MRGE with a dollar loss Friday of $-0.31000 and a Friction Factor of -2,165 shares. That means that it only took 2,165 more shares of selling than buying to move MRGE lower by one penny. This means the Market Makers are allowing the stock to drop quickly (low friction). The combination of low friction and negative market direction can drive prices lower faster than normal.

The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

CheckMEND the world's leading due diligence service for used consumer electronics today announced it has secured an agreement with GameStop to deploy its software in all GameStop's US stores to identify devices that are not eligible for trade.
Developed by UK-based Recipero, CheckMEND is a unique, cutting edge system that allows retailers and recyclers to proactively identify unacceptable devices and stop them from entering the supply chain.
Using data that is aggregated from over 20,000 data sources (including the FBI) CheckMEND provides access to its service to both enterprise and consumers. GameStop is the first major retailer in the US to integrate its application at point of sale. With a data warehouse containing over 150 billion records of information that is relevant to any buyer of used consumer electronics, CheckMEND is fast becoming the "go-to" data provider for this type of information.
Consumers are becoming more aware of the value that exists in their old electronics. That precipitates a need for reliable data and methods to ensure that retailers are protecting consumers. GameStop is leading the way for other retailers to follow suit.
"We are delighted that GameStop has stepped up to the forefront of consumer protection" said Adrian Portlock Founder of CheckMEND. "Our product allows GameStop to protect their customers, their associates in store and their reputable brand by deterring unwanted activity. GameStop has set the bar for other responsible retailers."
"GameStop will continue to invest in technology solutions that offer our customers the best and safest choice to buy, sell or trade video games, consoles and electronics" said Joe Gorman Vice President of Mobile at GameStop. "Working with CheckMEND, we have further enhanced our process, and we are already reaping the benefits of the service in our stores and our state of the art refurbishment center."

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM
WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades.
SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data.
The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

Full text:   Apr. 1, 2011 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) --
We wouldn't count on its retail business going away anytime soon, but it looks like GameStop is now also betting heavily on a digitally-distributed future. To that end, the company has just announced that it's acquiring both Spawn Labs and Steam-competitor Impulse, the latter of which it's buying out from parent company Stardock Systems. While Spawn Labs may not be the most familiar name, you might remember its HD-720 set-top box -- essentially a Slingbox for your game consoles -- which we first checked out way back in 2009 and finally started shipping in early 2010. It sounds like GameStop may have some even grander ambitions for the technology than that, however, as the company's press release says that it's now testing a "new consumer interface" that will give users "immediate access to a wide selection of high-definition video games on demand on any Internet-enabled device." As our pals at Joystiq note, that sounds an awful lot like OnLive-esque cloud-based gaming service, but GameStop unfortunately isn't offering many other hints at the moment. Show full PR textGameStop Announces Acquisition of Spawn Labs and Agreement to Acquire Impulse, Inc.Streaming technology company and digital distribution platform further advances GameStop's digital strategyGameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the world's largest multichannel video game retailer, today announced the acquisition of Spawn Labs, a streaming technology company. In addition, GameStop announced it has entered into an agreement to purchase Impulse, Inc., a subsidiary of Stardock Systems, Inc., and a leader in digital distribution. The Impulse acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in May 2011.Spawn Labs, part of the GameStop network, brings patented technology and a talented team of technologists with unique game streaming and virtualization expertise. The Spawn Labs team will work closely with GameStop's existing R&D group to develop GameStop's growing suite of digital game products and services.Once the Spawn Labs integration and testing on a new consumer interface is complete, users will have immediate access to a wide selection of high-definition video games on demand on any Internet-enabled device."Our customers are gaming in many locations and on many devices, and we need to deliver the same great immersive experience that they have come to expect," said GameStop President Tony Bartel. "Spawn Labs and Impulse provide a customer-friendly and publisher-friendly way for us to accomplish this."Impulse, Inc. provides a proven digital distribution platform that allows users to quickly and easily find their favorite games and download them to their Internet-connected devices.J. Paul Raines, chief executive officer of GameStop, said, "With these important acquisitions, we will continue to make appropriate investments related to our multichannel strategy. GameStop is uniquely positioned to be the leader in both the physical and digital gaming space."For users, developers and publishers, Impulse will offer three specific components:* Impulse::Client - allows gamers to have instant access to a library of more than 1,100 games on day one as well as the ability to manage their game-related downloads and purchases.* Impulse::Reactor - provides content publishers customer friendly DRM and copy protection tools. It also allows developers to enable achievements, account management, friend lists, chat, multiplayer lobbies, and cloud storage within their games.* Impulse::Publisher - allows publishers to manage all aspects of their game with powerful real-time reporting and management tools.Impulse, Inc. will remain an actively running business with full integration on GameStop.com anticipated within the next few months.

Market Gainer is quickly emerging as the one stop shop for international small-cap investors looking to stay a step ahead of the markets. Today's activity on the market has brought this company to the attention of our research team. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), is responding to the attention of investors. Our goal is to create a community of international investors who consistently and effectively capitalize on the enormous gains the small-cap Canadian and American exchanges offer.
GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer, reported sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year ended February 3, 2007. Please note that all per share data has been adjusted for the Class B share conversion and the two-for-one stock split that occurred subsequent to February 3, 2007.
Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Net earnings were $129.8 million for the 14-week fourth quarter of 2006, including debt retirement costs related to the bond buy- back program of $2.5 million ($1.6 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to net earnings of $85.0 million for the 13-week fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 52.7%.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.81, including debt retirement costs of $0.01 per diluted share, compared to $0.55 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, considerably beating guidance issued on January 4, 2007. Brisk sales in January of Vivendi's WORLD OF WARCRAFT and new video game software titles drove the greater than anticipated results.
GameStop sales increased 38.2% to $2,304.0 million in the fourth quarter, in comparison to $1,666.9 million in the prior year quarter. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 26.5% during the fourth quarter.
Full Year Financial Results
Net earnings were $158.3 million for the 53-week fiscal year 2006, including merger-related expenses of $6.8 million ($4.3 million, net of tax benefits) and debt retirement costs of $6.1 million ($3.8 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to earnings of $100.8 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 57.0%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.00 for fiscal 2006, including merger related expenses and debt retirement costs of $0.05 per diluted share, as compared to $0.81 per diluted share in fiscal 2005.
GameStop sales were $5,318.9 million for fiscal 2006, an increase of 72.0% over fiscal 2005 sales of $3,091.8 million. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 11.9% during fiscal 2006.
"2006 was a remarkable year for GameStop. Total sales increased 72%, operating earnings grew by 73%, net earnings were up 57%, and comparable store sales increased 12%; by any retail measurement, a remarkable year," indicated R. Richard Fontaine, GameStop's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, we finished the year with a strong balance sheet and a year end cash balance of over $650 million.
"During the year we successfully and fully integrated over 2,000 EB Games stores into the GameStop portfolio and opened 421 new stores worldwide; 276 in the United States and 145 in the international divisions. In fact, our internal rate of return for new stores was the highest ever and, in aggregate, significantly exceeded plan.
"While we are in the very early stages of another strong growth cycle, it is not a mirror of the past. In fact, our 2007 guidance is based on our belief that this cycle will be deeper, wider, and longer than any previous period of new console introductions. From the technology powerhouses of Xbox 360 and PS3, to the uniquely engaging ease of play and inventiveness of the Wii, to the portability of the DS Lite, to the value of the PS2, there is a product and a price range to stimulate the core and casual gamer, and attract new customers to the video game experience," continued Fontaine.
"No previous cycle has had the diversity of console attributes currently in our stores; no previous cycle has merged other technologies like HDTV, Wi-Fi, and MP3 attributes to make the gaming experience truly the best ever.
"The video game business has become more complex with more console choices, more sophisticated software, and a huge variety of enhancement accessories. The business is increasingly favoring the game passion and deep expertise of our 22,000 managers and game advisors whose product knowledge differentiates GameStop from the competition and will give us an even greater edge in the marketplace of the future."
Business Outlook
For fiscal 2007 (the 52-week year ending February 2, 2008), sales are projected to grow between 19.0% and 21.0%, with comparable store sales ranging from +14.0% to +16.0%, backed by a strong release slate of video game titles across all platforms. Diluted earnings per share for the full year are expected to range from $1.37 to $1.40. GameStop expects to open between 500-550 stores worldwide in 2007.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the company expects comparable store sales to range from +12.0% to +14.0%, driven by the expected launches of Sony's PlayStation 3 in Europe and Australia, Sony's GOD OF WAR II for the PlayStation 2 in the U.S., the worldwide launch of Nintendo's POKEMON DIAMOND and PEARL for the Nintendo DS, as well as continued strong demand for Microsoft Xbox 360 titles. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.15 to $0.16. This compares to earnings per share of $0.07 in the first quarter of 2006.
Based on expected strong video game industry fundamentals, the company's expanding worldwide retail portfolio, and sound cash generation, GameStop currently expects earnings per share to grow at least 25% annually in fiscals 2008 and 2009.
Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs.
Fourth quarter and full year 2005 pro forma statements of operations have been provided in Schedules III and IV as if the acquisition of Electronics Boutique Holding Corp. took place at the beginning of fiscal 2005. In addition, the pro forma statements of operations include stock-based compensation expense as if SFAS No. 123 was implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2005.
Conference Call and Webcast Information

Deals &amp; Deal Makers: GameStop Rises 12% on First Trading Day

Author: By Raymond Hennessey

Publication info: Wall Street Journal , Eastern edition; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]14 Feb 2002: C18.

http://elib.tcd.ie/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/deals-amp-deal-makers-gamestop-rises-12-on-first/docview/398870560/se-2?accountid=14404

Abstract: GameStop is the largest U.S. retailer that specializes in video and personal-computer games. It owns 1,038 stores under the GameStop, Babbage's, Software Etc. and FuncoLand brands, though it plans to change most of its stores to the GameStop name. The growth of GameStop's business has come on the heels of an explosion in interest in videogaming, particularly with the ever-widening platform of gaming consoles, including Sony Corp.'s PlayStation, Nintendo Co.'s Game Boy and GameCube, and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox. Unlike some other carve-outs recently, the GameStop deal isn't scheduled to be followed by a distribution of shares to Barnes & Noble shareholders. GameStop's shares carry voting rights more akin to a tracking stock than a common stock. After the offering, Barnes & Noble, which bought the company in October 1999, owns roughly 67% of all the outstanding stock of GameStop, though its shares carry more voting weight than those sold in the IPO. As a result, Barnes & Noble continues to control more than 95% of the voting power in GameStop.

Full text: NEW YORK -- GameStop Corp., the videogame retailer carved out of Barnes & Noble Inc., zapped 12% above its offering price in its debut as a public company.
While the IPO market isn't roaring, by any means, GameStop was the sixth initial public offering of stock to come out so far this month, after only one in January.
The IPO of the Grapevine, Texas, company on the New York Stock Exchange was priced at $18 per share -- the middle of the estimated range -- and by day's end traded $2.10 higher at $20.10. The IPO of 18 million shares was led by Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney. The stock's finish values the company, with its 54.1 million shares outstanding, at about $1.09 billion.
This was the second try for an offering. GameStop was originally scheduled to come to market late last year, and was to have traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The offering, though, was dormant until earlier this year, when the IPO market improved somewhat. It was resurrected with the NYSE listing.
GameStop is the largest U.S. retailer that specializes in video and personal-computer games. It owns 1,038 stores under the GameStop, Babbage's, Software Etc. and FuncoLand brands, though it plans to change most of its stores to the GameStop name. The growth of GameStop's business has come on the heels of an explosion in interest in videogaming, particularly with the ever-widening platform of gaming consoles, including Sony Corp.'s PlayStation, Nintendo Co.'s Game Boy and GameCube, and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox.
"Anybody with kids know that they get obsessed with these games," said Sal Morreale, who follows IPOs at Cantor Fitzgerald Inc. in Los Angeles. "It's big business."
Though it hasn't officially released results, in its latest quarter, ended Feb. 2, GameStop said it expects to report $510 million in sales, up from the $327 million booked in the comparable period a year ago. GameStop said it expects to report operating earnings for its latest quarter of $37 million, more than twice the $17 million reported a year earlier. Both periods include the all-important holiday sales season.
Unlike some other carve-outs recently, the GameStop deal isn't scheduled to be followed by a distribution of shares to Barnes & Noble shareholders. GameStop's shares carry voting rights more akin to a tracking stock than a common stock. After the offering, Barnes & Noble, which bought the company in October 1999, owns roughly 67% of all the outstanding stock of GameStop, though its shares carry more voting weight than those sold in the IPO. As a result, Barnes & Noble continues to control more than 95% of the voting power in GameStop.
Barnes & Noble benefits from the IPO in another way: GameStop plans to use $250 million of its proceeds to pay down debt owed to its parent.
With the GameStop offering completed, the IPO market is looking ahead to another Salomon-led IPO later in the week, for online payment company PayPal Inc.
PayPal, based in Palo Alto, Calif., delayed its offering last week, and later disclosed that it is the target of a patent-infringement lawsuit, could be the target of another, and has had some regulatory problems in four states. The company also disclosed that it may have run afoul of securities laws by speaking with an outside analyst during the registration period for the IPO.
The problems, though, appeared to have affected only the timing of the PayPal IPO, since price terms on the deal -- for an offering of 5.4 million shares at $12 to $14 a share -- have remained intact. People close to the offering insist it is ready to price tonight, with initial trading on Nasdaq tomorrow.
