\section{Technology Used}

There are various technologies used within this project. These are Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code, Git, AntConc 3.5.9, Rocksteady 0.4 and Gretl. Each of these had a different function within the project.

\subsection{Python 3.9}

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. The version used was version 3.9. 

Python was used in this project to develop and execute the procedures outlined in the implementation. This is due to the fact that python is a very useful language for handling projects which require a large amount of various different features as it is general purpose. For that reasons it has many publicly available libraries which help for many of the scenarios come across throughout development.

The libraries used had three main purposes: file handling, data tidying and mathematical operations.

\subsubsection{File Handling}

In order to handle the files downloaded from *lexisnexis* and *proquest*, various libraries had to be used. The libraries being `sys`, `os` and `striprtf`.

The `sys` library is used to allow communciation between different files in the program. It is used to create a global variable which allowed the setting of a source for files, and allowed this to be used throughout the various files in the program. The source being the choice between using *lexisnexis* and *proquest* files.

The `os` library is used interact directly with the system outside the program. It is used to access environment variables, as well as to help parse through files in a given directory.

The `striprtf` library is used to translate rtf to a usable format. When files are downloaded from *lexinexis* they are in rtf format, This library is used to help parsed the informaiton in these files into a usable format.
