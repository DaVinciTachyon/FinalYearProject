The conclusions should be a critique of your work: 
it should examine what has been achieved in the project and relate this to the initial aim of the project. 
Any problems encountered in the course of the project should be mentioned here.
The section on future work should give some indication of how work done could be improved and developed. 
Do not be afraid to discuss disadvantages of your approach. Negative results are useful.
