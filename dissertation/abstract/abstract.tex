\chapter*{Abstract}

The relationship between the market and sentiment is a question of great interest as well as great ramifications. Understanding if and how sentiment affects market prices and using that information in order to estimate future market returns has great consequences on the financial market.

There has been a significant amount of research into this area. However, there is still a long way to go to fully understand this area. Everything from how to best extract sentiment, the articles to examine and how to best analyse the results has ongoing research.

This project explores the questions of how to use qualitative data in a quantitative system, and what the relationship between sentiment and future market returns is. This requires a wide array of disciplines to be understood, making this a secondary objective. That is to explore and connect these areas in order to understand the subject matter in a much deeper and more meaningful way.
