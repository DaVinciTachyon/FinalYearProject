# An intelligent sentiment proxy analysis system for estimating price changes in financial markets

Final Year Project

## Todo

- To Implement
  - Vector Autoregression (Autoregression) (exogeneous Var)
  - sentiment error given limited sample size
  - be able to test different periods
  - Python packages install
- Implementation
  - Diagrams
  - Efficiencies such as += vs "".join()
  - Caching
- Discussion and Conclusion
  - Define LexisNexis Articles and their types - call it article corpus?
  - Define sentiment proxy
  - Define proxy
  - Define Gamestop - why gamestop? What happened? Why did it happen? gamestop bubble? reaction of small investors to big investors? quote? ordinary company pos->neg->pos return
  - Define Descriptive Statistics Elements
  - Define Correlation
  - Define Vector Autoregression
  - explore ml models, in futre distinguih between them, explore differences
  - Use results explored in slides
  - (pos sent vs neg sent) ratio vs returns + error
  - volume vs returns - volume indicated change, change indicates sentiment
  - Graphs/Diagrams
  - Conditional (same descriptive stats no matter sample size) Vs Unconditional (descriptive stats change) Returns - Change sample size - look at different periods
  - models based on modellers view of world
  - correlaiton between magnitude of returns
  - correlation error, pvalue, etc.
  - Display all values then narrow down to statistically significant values
  - bring up receiver/sender bias - feedback loop
  - economic policy uncertainty index
  - Why specific timespan? Why 7000 articles from lexisnexis
  - Panel Regression?
  - Study Change not absolutes
  - Fashions
  - How many std devs in sentiment for 1 std dev in price
  - mean reversal - movement around mean
  - efficient market hypothesis
  - small error when market is well behaved
  - statistically signifant >90%
- Background
- Introduction
  - What have I learnt? nlp, financial concepts, econometrics, behavioural psychology
  - innovative system
  - statistical estimation
  - change in facts, not absolute facts
  - 0 point motion
  - bachelier
  - naive trader vs informaed trader
  - demand vs supply
  - created system that is more than the sum of its parts
  - research papers
  - systematically organised corpus of texts
  - studied domain, unerstand how to computerise it
  - Qualitative -> Quantitative -> Market Dynamics (description -> correlation -> causation/dependence)
  - diffentiate between correlation and causation, causation has to be stastically significant
  - What is impacting the market?
  - conceptualisation
  - negative words are important < 2,3 %, otherwise lie, if high negative sentiment, important news
- Nomenclature
- Abstract
- Ackowledgments
- Bibliography
  - Papers read
  - Paper from slides
  - Papers given by Khurshid
  - Tetlock?
- Appendix
- Declaration
- Spell Check
- Proof Read
