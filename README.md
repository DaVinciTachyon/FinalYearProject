# An intelligent sentiment proxy analysis system for estimating price changes in financial markets

Final Year Project

## Todo

- To Implement
  - Vector Autoregression (Autoregression) (exogeneous Var)
  - Additional ML Models
  - Correlation error
  - Python packages install
  - Next day return instead of T/F
- Implementation
  - Diagrams
  - Efficiencies such as += vs "".join()
  - Caching
- Discussion and Conclusion
  - Define LexisNexis Articles and their types - call it article corpus?
  - Define sentiment proxy
  - Define Gamestop - why gamestop? What happened? Why did it happen? gamestop bubble?
  - Define Descriptive Statistics Elements
  - Define Correlation
  - Define Vector Autoregression
  - Use results explored in slides
  - (pos sent vs neg sent) ratio vs returns + error
  - volume vs returns - volume indicated change, change indicates sentiment
  - Graphs/Diagrams
  - Conditional Vs Unconditional Returns - Change sample size
  - Display all values then narrow down to statistically significant values
  - bring up receiver/sender bias - feedback loop
  - economic policy uncertainty index
  - Why specific timespan? Why 7000 articles from lexisnexis
  - Panel Regression?
  - Study Change not absolutes
  - Fashions
  - How many std devs in sentiment for 1 std dev in price
  - mean reversal - movement around mean
  - efficient market hypothesis
